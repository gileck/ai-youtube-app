blue light is not bad for us it&amp;#39;s actually extremely important how are you going to be able to optimize for that environment if you&amp;#39;re getting this distorted input they do that by keeping you on device on screen in app longer and they&amp;#39;re transmitting a signal through your brain I really think we&amp;#39;re setting up our children for failure that&amp;#39;s wild and no one&amp;#39;s talking about this it&amp;#39;s a tragedy what&amp;#39;s up guys welcome to this week&amp;#...

at a high level I would say maybe even more important that that infrared light is one of the biggest nutrient deficiencies because of our modern indoor environment and and what we did in the morning today is vitally important for many different reasons and we got out there right after we woke up the sun you know hadn&amp;#39;t even crested The Horizon so we&amp;#39;re giving our body all the right input signals we&amp;#39;re getting that you know high-intensity brightness compared to an indoor e...

to what you said in the pineal gland but uh I don&amp;#39;t know the exact percentage but this paper which is from an Optics engineer Scott Zimmerman who is fantastic and my background is in electrical engineering and I love the kind of engineering approach to things because it&amp;#39;s more mechanistic it&amp;#39;s holistic we&amp;#39;d like to get to the root cause of things whereas I think even the great researchers out there can get a little bit siloed and and miss the bigger picture so it&...

Content length: 2905 chars, ~494 words

Master antioxidant you can say it&amp;#39;s really incredible and for me when I started going down this Rabbit Hole it really kicked off my understanding and firm Gra grasp of how vastly important circadian health is sunlight is and just light because once you learn how potent melatonin is across the board you just can&amp;#39;t unsee it I think it quite literally can quench like 8 to 10 free radicals because it has this cascading effect to where once you oxidize melatonin well then its byproduc...

micrometers whereas the visible range is only from 400 net to around 700 nmet it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very narrow what we can actually see visibly so it&amp;#39;s this vast spectrum of light and from a sunlight just percentage perspective people throw around numbers like 50 55% of the light is infrared this paper highlights from a photons per second perspective it&amp;#39;s on average 70% infrared light so the vast majority of sunlight is infrared and that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s always...

Content length: 15608 chars, ~2665 words

everything we&amp;#39;re mentioning here is because there&amp;#39;s an imbalance in these artificial environments because there&amp;#39;s no infrared and why is there no infrared because glass and because indoor lighting is completely omitting that and just not putting it back in and that&amp;#39;s a byproduct of this modern lighting transformation and overall just the environments uh we&amp;#39;re living in and to me it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be that way it could be a very simple ...

people listening to this podcast might be in an office setting when I was in my residency right I&amp;#39;m in the hospital or in an office all day long 12 hours I live my residency at the University of Washington in Seattle I would get to the hospital at 6:30 5:30 in the morning the lights the sun&amp;#39;s not even up in the winter in Seattle I have essentially no infrared exposure I rode my bike to the hospital when I was in my residency because they charge for parking so much so in the summe...

because you&amp;#39;re not getting a ton of the visible um you&amp;#39;re getting a tiny bit of blue more green more yellow more orange more red and then even more infrared and it goes far into like the mid infrared spectrum and it&amp;#39;s close it&amp;#39;s very close to sunlight in terms of the infrar red um kind of spectrum that you&amp;#39;re getting uh but I think it&amp;#39;s even more important because we&amp;#39;re so deficient in infrared light because glass is filtering it out um Bey...

they&amp;#39;re decent um but we can do better and I think low power incandescent where we&amp;#39;re getting some infrared as well is is far better and what&amp;#39;s cool is you know Scott Zimmerman the guy who wrote the the paper on melatonin he&amp;#39;s come up with a light bulb that is a combination of LED and incandescent oh wow and he just squeaked under these Energy Efficiency standards that exist of 45 lumens per watt by doing so because the normal incandescent is like way too ineffici...

getting maybe even more of a percentage like 80 plus% of photons could be infrared light and that&amp;#39;s why we feel really good like Forest bathing obviously fresh air and ground if you&amp;#39;re doing that but it might be mostly because of infrared light so I think in the winter time when we do have you know this Seasonal effective disorder everyone does to some degree because we&amp;#39;re not connected to the local environment and getting incandescent infrared back is is really important...

energy right this is energy for our biology and we mentioned you know earlier I was asking about like the whole calorie debate and it&amp;#39;s really funny to me because people get so fixated on these closed loop SI systems of our bodies is like yeah it&amp;#39;s just the energy you eat and that&amp;#39;s it and it&amp;#39;s like no this is a very multifaceted equation of input signals and I&amp;#39;m an engineer I think about everything like like an engineer so all we need to do to improve the...

has lower flick well technically higher flicker rate but in my opinion lower flicker um in terms of its effect on you and then it&amp;#39;s further away so I think the more time you can spend looking at a laptop versus your phone is better and then you know what we&amp;#39;re trying to do at daylight is improve the entire thing to be completely flicker free and have no blue light so you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about any of that and then you mentioned the kids this is you know what makes me m...
