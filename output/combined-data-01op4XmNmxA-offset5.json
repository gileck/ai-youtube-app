      "content": "everything we&amp;#39;re mentioning here is because there&amp;#39;s an imbalance in these artificial environments because there&amp;#39;s no infrared and why is there no infrared because glass and because indoor lighting is completely omitting that and just not putting it back in and that&amp;#39;s a byproduct of this modern lighting transformation and overall just the environments uh we&amp;#39;re living in and to me it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be that way it could be a very simple fix to put infrared back in but we just need to acknowledge that this is a serious problem so it&amp;#39;s really cool because again i&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve been you know I was in this health Journey for a while but I realized that this electromagnetic this light piece is so huge and it actually started with melatonin and I think it&amp;#39;s a good place to start because I think most people know melatonin&amp;#39;s important but this is like another layer on top so I thought about this before the podcast and I almost wanted to bring an incandescent light in here with us or something because we are essentially getting no infrared in the studio right now so we&amp;#39;re doing this for you guys so all of you listening to the podcast we are of course sitting under blue lights we&amp;#39;re going to go outside to Barton Springs after the podcast and hopefully try and repair some of this and whatever we&amp;#39;ll survive we won&amp;#39;t die but this is this is perhaps simulating or this is exactly the environment that a lot of us work in a full blue light environment like this without infrared as you mentioned this is such a fascinating concept that in I&amp;#39;ll just say this again so people understand so when we&amp;#39;re outside in the sun different times of the day have different wavelengths so in the morning here in Austin Texas we&amp;#39;re out there at 7:30 in the morning there&amp;#39;s no UV a or UVB and those are short wavelength lights you know in terms of we can talk nanometers for most of this but those are the shorter wavelength lights over the course of the day even though it&amp;#39;s January there might be a little bit of UV we might actually have some vitamin D winter here where we I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;ll be some UV at some point during the day in Austin in January yeah so there&amp;#39;s what you mentioned UVA and UVB is important because UVA is is typically always present at some point in the day even in Winter unless you go to like extremely extremely high latitudes okay um and that&amp;#39;s typically coming up pretty shortly after Sunrise like within an hour the I believe the sun only needs to be like 10 degrees above the Horizon to get ultraviolet a okay and that&amp;#39;s important for for a lot of biological functions but UVB is the one that we&amp;#39;re more familiar with because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s really needed to synthesize vitamin D and and a lot of hormones and that like in Wyoming where I live is absent right now unless you go to like really high elevation um and you probably needed to be at High Noon cuz I believe it&amp;#39;s 30° above the Horizon Sun angle you need for Vitamin D UVB um to to occur okay so yeah I don&amp;#39;t know about here in Austin maybe at at midday but yeah hopefully when we get done with this podcast at noon we&amp;#39;ll get a little bit of UVB light but when not let&amp;#39;s just say Costa Rica or somewhere or let&amp;#39;s just say the summer in Austin for people to understand throughout the course of the day the wavelengths change eventually UV B shows up after UVA and then you&amp;#39;re getting all these visible wavelengths that we talked about red orange blue green Violet and then you have infrared on the long end of the Spectrum in terms of wavelengths and you said infrared is 700 plus nanometer 750 all the way to 2,00 to you know 2500 even to the micrometer range and so you&amp;#39;re getting these infr red wavelengths and so when you&amp;#39;re sitting indoors I mean we have a spectrometer here we could look but we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re under bright blue lights but most people are working under fluorescent lights there&amp;#39;s no UVA or UVB indoors so we&amp;#39;ll what we&amp;#39;re actually under right now there there are visible wavelengths which are probably over representing blue right if we&amp;#39;re indoors and then there&amp;#39;s no infrared so there&amp;#39;s nothing near infrared far infrared none of that indoors and so this is such an interesting point and just so people know if they want to look at this article we&amp;#39;ll put a link in the description the article you sent me is melatonin and the Optics of the human body the articles are Scott Zimmerman and Russell J Ryder and this was a A New Concept for me I didn&amp;#39;t understand this before that there&amp;#39;s a cellular pool of melatonin that we have outside of the brain and like you said this melatonin is used as an antioxidant connected with glutathione this tripeptide that many of us have heard of some of us even supplement glutathione sometimes we think of glut glutathione as the master antioxidant but melatonin is interacting with that during the day and so how interesting that infrared light has an a sun protective factor and again it it kind of all comes back to this ethos that I consistently see occurring in this space that what we have evolved doing is what our bodies are expecting whether it&amp;#39;s food or light environment or sleep or circadian rhythms and so of course light is a food in some ways light is a nutrient and I&amp;#39;m sure other people have said this that when we have blue light indoors this is a processed food of light this is a we&amp;#39;re essentially I&amp;#39;m eating Cheetos I&amp;#39;m eating light Cheetos right now unfortunately and I try not to I don&amp;#39;t eat Cheetos in my normal life but sometimes for you guys to make a podcast I&amp;#39;ll eat some light Cheetos but that&amp;#39;s a tricky thing for people and so we&amp;#39;ll talk in the podcast about how to mitigate that how to create better light environments to get Whole Food light throughout the day so what do we have for spectrum here yeah so you can see and spectrometers are fantastic but they don&amp;#39;t cover like how vast the infrared range is I I I need to upgrade but you can at least see we have a very high spike in the blue range like very this is classic LED Spectrum so oh yeah let me I think that caught some of the INF the incandescent oh there is an incandescent there it might be I think so oh wow I didn&amp;#39;t notice that we have a really high Spike at 456 nanometers that&amp;#39;s like the peak wavelength here and then we have you know a some some of the rest of the visible but then you see as we get to like 700 nomers which is where the infrared starts it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty much zero it&amp;#39;s zero so you can see that we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re completely deficient can we check these let&amp;#39;s check the incandescence because this is part of the solution we&amp;#39;re going from you know a vast spectrum of light to where we have all you know what I mentioned 70% of the photons coming from sunlight are infrared and now that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s zero so and those photons are essential to make a vitamin quote unquote in our bodies melatonin at a subcellular level in the mitochondria and if we don&amp;#39;t make that melatonin we&amp;#39;re potentially causing harm for our bodies we have an near infrared and infrared deficiency that&amp;#39;s wild yeah and those lights are not incandescent because this I don&amp;#39;t even know what this is that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a weird LED kind of combination but you can see it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s also very artificial and contains absolutely no infrared there&amp;#39;s no infrared barely any red and has some weird spikes to it so that&amp;#39;s like more of a warmer LED Spectrum whereas these are like cool LEDs which super high in blue so super high in blue here yeah and as you talked about so maybe that&amp;#39;s talk about blue light and then we&amp;#39;ll go to infrared um so what&amp;#39;s the problem with this blue light Tristan so we have you mentioned blue light is a high power light which is high energy light it&amp;#39;s a low it&amp;#39;s a low small wavelength so what are the wavelengths for blue light uh around like 400 or 420 to like 4 480 490 is this kind of the range nanometers nanometers yeah so the nanometers so just basic I know we&amp;#39;re going to talk a lot about different areas of the electromagnetic spectrum so an electromagnetic wave is um you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s photonic in nature and every electromagnetic wave is measured by its frequency its energy and its wavelength so frequency and and energy are directly correlated so if it&amp;#39;s a higher frequency you get higher energy right and then the opposite for wavelength wavelength is inversely correlated with that so if you have a longer wavelength which is like infrared light you have lower energy and lower frequency so blue light typically ranges in the wavelength of you know 410 420 to like 490 nanometers and that is a higher energy wave length it&amp;#39;s on the high end of the visible spectrum so out of all the colors we can see blue and then Violet are the highest energy and then ultraviolet which we can&amp;#39;t see is even higher energy and shorter wavelength than that and higher energy means it&amp;#39;s impacting our biology at a you know a stronger level and it&amp;#39;s inducing more oxidative stress radical free radical production I I should be careful by saying oxidative stress because that&amp;#39;s really only true if if it&amp;#39;s gotten out of control so it has more of an oxidative result but if we have the proper environment and mechanisms in place that will be dealt with appropriately and it&amp;#39;s good because reactive oxygen species in my opinion get they get a really bad rep because this is cellular signaling our mitochondria are the Hub of cellular communication and this reactive oxygen species are telling our body what happens like in order to produce vitamin D we need to induce you know oxidative production at the cellular level and that Cascade of effects occurs and it&amp;#39;s like okay let&amp;#39;s produce melanin you know let&amp;#39;s produce vitamin D as a result of that exposure to this high energy light and the same thing all light is going to induce some radical production but the higher energy the wavelength the higher amount and it&amp;#39;s the same thing like you could you know say that the reactive oxygen species generated from infrared light exposure uh maybe what&amp;#39;s kicking off the cellular signal to then produce melatonin to clean it all up it&amp;#39;s not necessarily a bad thing it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s signals that we&amp;#39;ve evolved with and been been a part of our existence for millions of years as preh homedes hundreds of thousands of years as Homo sapiens oxidative stress gets a bad WAP because oxidative stress is referring to an imbalance between oxidation and reduction we have both processes happening in our bodies but if we completely quote quench all of the free radicals in our body we die we need reactive oxygen species to signal so this is not a bad thing and and this is some of my hesitation with some of these you know things like supplements yeah supplements you know over supplementing with antioxidants um I&amp;#39;ll have to have somebody on the future on in the future to talk about hydrogen water but the you know it&amp;#39;s like at a certain level I have questions about this you don&amp;#39;t want to get rid of all of the oxidants you know all of the reactive oxygen species in your body your mitochondria won&amp;#39;t work without reactive oxygen species it&amp;#39;s about a balance as everything is and so yeah some of these wavelengths May induce oxidative reactions in the body body they may induce reactive oxygen species and the question then becomes with blue light could exposure to imbalanced forms of blue light like this cause oxidate stress could it imbalance things right and there&amp;#39;s some evidence of that isn&amp;#39;t there absolutely at the level of the eye with acute macular degeneration or age related macular degeneration you sent me an article about that yeah the one the one that I sent you is yeah they basically isolated the light the wavelengths and exposed them to you know cells in the retina and they looked at the mitochondria uh from those exposures and they did a whole vast you know spectrum of light honing in on the blue light and the red uh wavelengths and they basically found that the blue light exposure um and you know I think 450 maybe 470 nanometers was was the peak of it it damaged mitochondria like they they died at a higher rate and the amount of mitochondria per cell went down drastically from this isolated blue light exposure and you know reactive oxygen species were were through the roof the you know membrane potential the mitochondria was was you know far reduced and then they did the same thing with the red light and the red light actually improved it from the control so it shows that when you have this isolated light experience especially in the blue that&amp;#39;s not being balanced by the red and infrared then you&amp;#39;re going to have you know cellular damage from from blue light exposure this was specifically at at the retina level but this could be true in in many areas of the body and there&amp;#39;s been some some interesting studies done with you know skin cancer and things correlating artificial light exposure very strongly to to skin cancer to melanoma they&amp;#39;re and they&amp;#39;re always very controversial like highly controversial and it makes sense because what did we say at the beginning here melatonin is the master antioxidant it&amp;#39;s anti-cancer I think everyone agrees with that like that&amp;#39;s pretty much not debated very so if infrared light exposure is going to stimulate melatonin production uh you know vastly at the sub cellular level and we are getting this high energy visible exposure from Blue Light uh with none of the infrared and none of the Melatonin then then we&amp;#39;re missing that so you could say is it the blue light then or is it the the lack of infrared and that&amp;#39;s where to me it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter because we just need to change our environment of lighting and in that same p they said 8 hours in the office lighting which contains no UV exposure generates the same amount of free radical production as 30 minutes in direct sunlight but there&amp;#39;s no infrared so you&amp;#39;re getting none of that cleanup so then you really have an A redo problem uh an oxidative stress issue that cannot be emphasized enough thank you for mentioning that the article we&amp;#39;re talking about is the light action Spectrum on oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in a2e loaded retinal pigment epithelium cells this is cell death and disease which is one of the nature journals it&amp;#39;s February 2018 the first author uh is Melanie Marie and if people want to look up that article but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the issue here is that you&amp;#39;re imbalancing it and so we have a situation where a lot of people listening to this podcast might be in an office setting when I was in my residency right I&amp;#39;m in the hospital or in an office all day long 12 hours I",

that&amp;#39;s another benefit of an Inc incent bulb yeah definitely let&amp;#39;s talk about flicker so this bulb is an incandescent bulb that you ordered to the Airbnb and this is interesting because at the Airbnb I have zero flicker quote red LEDs that I got from a company in Australia I use them at night people have probably seen them in my reels I&amp;#39;ll do a video you know I did a what how I you know a day in my life when I&amp;#39;m traveling and at the end of that that little reel on Instagram and everywhere else I have this zero flicker quote red LED and I thought oh cool it&amp;#39;s a zero flicker LED because I&amp;#39;m thinking about the flicker but as you&amp;#39;re mentioning there&amp;#39;s no infrared and there&amp;#39;s no other visible spectrum I think it&amp;#39;s still a good thing to have red lights in my house at night I&amp;#39;m trying to protect my circadian rhythms in my eyes in the super chmatic nucleus from the blue light we can talk about that but this is an interesting nutrient here that you sent and you said most of what you use you live in Wyoming predominantly is in candescent bulbs during the day so here&amp;#39;s the solution for people so this is probably the most important part that we&amp;#39;re going to talk about thus far in the podcast and I had never thought about this till you open my eyes to this these incandescent bulbs are a solution this is a multivitamin for light for you in your house and so let&amp;#39;s why don&amp;#39;t you put see if you can put this bulb in there and we can test it yeah so I brought this incandescent bulb and Tristan&amp;#39;s going to put it yeah yeah so we&amp;#39;ll put an in I should have brought two incandescent bulbs you know this is fake incandescent yeah yeah so this is a fake incandescent you can see it&amp;#39;s an LED bulb which is why the Spectrum didn&amp;#39;t work it looks cool but the spectrum of light coming out is is not what we want so here we have a real incandescent bulb in the in the outlet and let&amp;#39;s test it in a second and we&amp;#39;ll be able to see that there are infrared wavelengths in this B you want how about I&amp;#39;ll undo this one it&amp;#39;ll be fine I can get close enough all right wow that is wild guys okay so you can see this so what you see is you have a ton so we went back to the LED Spectrum where we have a huge Spike at 457 net you know the rest of the visible spectrum is there and then it just completely falls off at 700 whereas for the incandescent bulb you have like a tiny amount of blue more green more yellow more red and then a ton of infrared and this doesn&amp;#39;t even capture the full infrared if if this went going off the chart it would just keep going like this and then it what&amp;#39;s the what&amp;#39;s the top of the the wavelength there the peak wavelength the maximum that this reach which is 780 and it would keep going higher and higher 2,500 yeah and then it would level off around you know 2 three micrometers I think but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s V It&amp;#39;s Full Spectrum Lighting and that&amp;#39;s what I want to emphasize here is nature there&amp;#39;s only two sources of light in nature it&amp;#39;s the Sun and it&amp;#39;s fire and that&amp;#39;s what we have evolved with and during the day you get full spectrum sunlight which includes everything from UV to infrared and you never get the higher energy shorter wavelengths without the infrared and then at night time we evolved with fire and it was typically low angle on the ground and the fire looks like this it looks like a 10:1 ratio of infrared divisible no ultraviolet barely any green and blue and a ton of infrared so for me I used to have all these red LEDs and do like red light therapy in my home as well but those are really isolated wavelengths you&amp;#39;re getting like 680 or 650 and then maybe for infrared light therapy you&amp;#39;re getting you know 800 850 and you know it&amp;#39;s great because photob biomodulation is real and those wavelengths can be helpful but it&amp;#39;s also unnatural and the bad part is if you want to get into you know in general how it&amp;#39;s affecting our eyes and circadian rhythm why are we using red lights because blue light disrupts melatonin production around three to four times the rate of red light it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that red light won&amp;#39;t disrupt your melatonin or orange or anything any light can any light exposure and the intensity of that light as well so the the study I reference and huberman tweets a lot is I think 2500 locks versus 500 Lux and it was the same light spectrum um had like a 3X reduction in in serum melatonin levels at night time 2500 yeah so 5x the brightness had a 3X reduction in melatonin with the same same spectrum of light so it&amp;#39;s the combination of the color of spectrum and the intensity and the brightness so why is red light a problem well our photo receptors are not sensitive at all to Red Light uh so when you have this very isolated red light wavelength I mean anyone who has gone full red mode on their phone or wearing blue light blockers you know like this you you can&amp;#39;t really see super well so what do you have to do you have to end up like turning up the brightness a little bit or need more lights typically um and it&amp;#39;s also the average person&amp;#39;s never going to do this so for me um they&amp;#39;re not really a great solution they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re decent um but we can do better and I think low power incandescent where we&amp;#39;re getting some infrared as well is is far better and what&amp;#39;s cool is you know Scott Zimmerman the guy who wrote",

      "content": "they&amp;#39;re decent um but we can do better and I think low power incandescent where we&amp;#39;re getting some infrared as well is is far better and what&amp;#39;s cool is you know Scott Zimmerman the guy who wrote the the paper on melatonin he&amp;#39;s come up with a light bulb that is a combination of LED and incandescent oh wow and he just squeaked under these Energy Efficiency standards that exist of 45 lumens per watt by doing so because the normal incandescent is like way too inefficient so he&amp;#39;s getting creative and he&amp;#39;s the only person I know that&amp;#39;s doing this obviously because he has a deep knowledge on this topic but I would like to see more Innovation on the lighting space and not just be like yeah red LED or orange LED which a lot of these you know standard ones still have like flicker as well but Full Spectrum Lighting is is really important and and people like John a you know health and light that he wrote decades ago discussed this as well that whether it&amp;#39;s isolated blue or red at the cellular level our body doesn&amp;#39;t like isolated wavelengths for a long period of time for a short period of time it&amp;#39;s okay but he found he did all this testing with like pink fluorescent lights what is short versus long yeah how bad is this 2 and 1 half hour podcast isolated like even red and orange he found that like for for for hours and hours of exposure these rats and mice went like cannibalistic they had the worst outcomes compared to even like fluorescent and white Lighting on pure pink light on pure like pink and like more narrow wavelength lighting um but then he he he found that for like 20 30 minutes it&amp;#39;s actually like a calming effect and when you look at nature sunrises sunsets they last like 20 30 45 let&amp;#39;s say an hour at longest when you&amp;#39;re getting these kind of bright pinks and oranges past that it&amp;#39;s full spectrum it&amp;#39;s either you know a fire which is is broad spectrum as we see here or it&amp;#39;s like proper sunlight which has a swath of wavelengths so I would say we should be cautious about any very narrow band isolated light because the Sun and fire are Broadband emitters and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s existing in nature I just want to pause the podcast for one minute to tell you guys about a company that I&amp;#39;m super proud of which is my company heart and soil supplements we make grass-fed grassfish desiccated organs this is whole package it&amp;#39;s one of my favorite ones it contains testicle and believe me this works there&amp;#39;s so much interesting research regarding organs and their effect on our corresponding organs it&amp;#39;s probably something about the micrornas in this organ but the nutrients in here taking testicles affects humans look at the reviews men have improved rectile dysfunction improved testosterone improved energy we have a women supplement too called her package we have all of our supplements at the website heartand soil. if you need more nutrition in your life if you&amp;#39;re not eating organs check check us out this will radically improve your health I promise you I&amp;#39;m so proud of what we built our mission is to help you reclaim your Birthright to radical Health back to the podcast so what do you think about and we&amp;#39;re going to get to flicker what do you think about me using zero flicker red LEDs at night so like we talked about blue light so I we&amp;#39;ll just talk about this for a moment so people understand what we&amp;#39;re talking about once the sun goes down and I&amp;#39;m even sensitive in the afternoon so even in the like waning hours of the day before the sun goes down I I feel like my sleep is negatively affected if I&amp;#39;m around bright blue lights if I&amp;#39;m outside whatever the natural light of the sun is the Circadian rhythm of the Sun and it&amp;#39;s just changing throughout the day that&amp;#39;s fine what is problematic for me is when I am under blue lights if I go to a restaurant I went to a restaurant here in Austin I won&amp;#39;t say the name of the restaurant because I like the food and I like their sourcing but they had horrible lights horrible lights and I sat down at the table with my friends and I thought this sucks right it&amp;#39;s a nice restur restur and they don&amp;#39;t have good lights okay restaurant teers if you are listening to this all of the lights in your restaurant should be incandescent guys every single restaurant I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many stores I&amp;#39;ve been to in Austin how many restaurants I&amp;#39;ve been to they have horrible light I went to a clothing store in Austin and they had horrible LED light if you want your business to be better and ahead of the curve you need to have incandescent lights they don&amp;#39;t have incandescent lights and my sleep that night was Disturbed and I think that was related to the Flicker and the spectrum of the light in the restaurant and so at night once once the sun has gone down wherever I am I am not trying to have blue lights on I turn all the lights off in the house I travel with zero flicker red LEDs that to me seems like a reasonable thing I suppose the other option would be incandescence on the floor because doesn&amp;#39;t the placement of the light matter you know a fire is below me if my airbnbs would come with little fire pits indoors and some venting so not inhaling the smoke I would have fire and I Don&amp;#39;t Love candles because a lot of candles are soy or you know these other synthetic candles that relas talline and Benzene and other endocrine disruptors into the air so if you guys are using candles Beeswax is the only type of candle that I would use even that is polluting the air with particulate in some level you can measure this but do not use a soy based candle do not use a synthetic candle in any way shape or form so I&amp;#39;m not going to use candles so I feel like the red LED is the best I could do unless I have maybe an incandescent bulb at at like my feet level what do you think the best thing is at night I think a combination of those two I think low powered in desent like low angle is is great cuz that&amp;#39;s like closest to what fire would be so low angle&amp;#39;s below my field of vision not as long as it&amp;#39;s not overhead again we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re nitpicking here I think if you can get rid of Bright Lights like drastically then you are doing a great job so try to turn off the lights as much as you can overhead lights completely get rid of and just have like a couple lamps or whatever you need yeah whatever you need to like what whatever you&amp;#39;re doing like get your work done at night if you&amp;#39;re on your laptop and we can talk about displays and screens as well but you know whatever you need and and for me I&amp;#39;m what I&amp;#39;m saying is for most people like they&amp;#39;re not going to just illuminate their house in red LEDs because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of weird and but it&amp;#39;s weird in a good way people dig it it is it can be it can be like a Vibe you know like red light dis some Vibes but it is hard to see sometimes and that&amp;#39;s because of what I mentioned of our photo receptor sensitivity so if you can balance like a little low power incandescent and some red LEDs I think both of those are are great Solutions but it&amp;#39;s like if you can get a little bit of infrared exposure you know I I like the incandescence for for that and it it&amp;#39;s calming it&amp;#39;s uh you know you mentioned the restaurants like you will get an increase in just like customer response and like feel if you have warm like it&amp;#39;s just it passes the grandma test like ask ask your grandma or you know older relative like what kind of lights do you like and they&amp;#39;re like yeah something warm in tone like the flicker people don&amp;#39;t even realize that it&amp;#39;s stressing them out but they know like I was trying to convince my dad about this and he&amp;#39;s like yeah my my my girlfriend loves like incandescent she&amp;#39;s all on board cuz it&amp;#39;s just warm and like comfortable and if that&amp;#39;s what we need to do to sell it in terms of ambiance like I I&amp;#39;m all for that like let&amp;#39;s make you know make America Amber and incandescent again that&amp;#39;s like I posted about but yeah the red LEDs are are good solutions that can be a bit more you know portable and you know you just plug them in it&amp;#39;s hard to travel with glass bulbs um yeah but I love what you said earlier an incandesent bulb is basically fire in a bottle yep in some ways it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s and I wonder I mean we just tested it with the the spectrometer but there is glass around the tungsten filament it&amp;#39;s not taking out all we talked about this last night I think that that glass is so thin uh that it&amp;#39;s not having a major impact on I mean CU we&amp;#39;re measuring the spectrometer outside the glass whereas in your house double pane windows now most windows are what are what&amp;#39;s called Low e low emissivity so they&amp;#39;re even more quote unquote energy efficient which means they&amp;#39;re blocking even more infrared whereas my house in Wyoming is like built in the 60s I have like single plane glass single pane glass windows they&amp;#39;re better they&amp;#39;re still not great but that&amp;#39;s something and then ultraviolet that&amp;#39;s filtering out any of the the ult Violet as well and windshield glass yep so driving if you drive a lot I drive a lot you open the wind open the windows as much as you can that&amp;#39;s fantastic but I did a funny little experiment I told you about I drove to Canada 10 hours the other week and I have 120 volts in my car as a 4Runner and I bought these mini incandescents and I just plugged them in and shine them on my face and I will say I did not feel super fatigued at the end of the drive like I did not feel feel like super drained and like I felt good so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like okay we can&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t change the blue light in every capacity like there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s some imbalance happening so if we can&amp;#39;t get rid of the blue light which you shouldn&amp;#39;t be wearing blue light blockers during the day either and that&amp;#39;s what I want to emphasize we need blue light during the day that is what&amp;#39;s driving wakefulness and cortisol like helpful cortisol uh so you can get stuff done and dopamine during the day like blue light is more driving it&amp;#39;s driving the cuz you get the cortisol Awakening response in the morning it&amp;#39;s driving actually probably the drop of cortisol isn&amp;#39;t it yeah but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s driving uh timing cortisol PE blue light is the main what&amp;#39;s called sight Gaber or time Giver to our our circadian system Z yeah zit G um so you can really do yourself a disservice by not getting enough blue light during the day and all of these circadian studies what they show is both the combin of brighter days and darker nights is what&amp;#39;s improving all ca&amp;#39;s mortality now their study out there metabolic health and also Sleep Quality so it&amp;#39;s the combination of brighter days and darker nights and brighter days includes blue light but if you can&amp;#39;t you know fix the blue light aspect of these led Peaks from the screens and the lighting well then let&amp;#39;s add back in the infrared and balance this out so you can get you know the protection from the Melatonin produ",

      "content": "went on Amazon and I bought two of those 250 watt chicken lights that was $21 for two lights and I got a portable um little lamp that&amp;#39;s for a chicken Coupe and it was $17 and so this is going to be part of my traveling setup when I go to the States now because I&amp;#39;m working indoors now in Costa Rica at the equator I&amp;#39;ve kind of got it&amp;#39;s easier for me all of the windows in my house are open so I&amp;#39;m getting infrared light coming in through the through the windows the glass is not between me there&amp;#39;s so much light in Costa Rica that was the main reason one of the main reasons besides surfing that I felt like I wanted to live there we were talking about this on the walk and I think if people can live near the equator that is how to be light wealthy I felt wealthy from a light perspective when I went to Costa Rica both from the ultraviolet perspectives I felt I was tan you know I have sunlight even versus Austin I lose my tan when I come to the states and from an infrared perspective without knowing it and from a circadian rhythm perspective so what I&amp;#39;ll say to people is if you can move to the tropics explore it that&amp;#39;s at least my perspective and for those of you listening to the podcast we were talking about this on the walk I really want to gather a community of people in Costa Rica that are good switched on people so I&amp;#39;m doing an animal-based gathering in Costa Rica in May the animal based nutrition Research Foundation is my nonprofit it&amp;#39;s abnf toorgle based Gathering but if you guys are into this stuff and you&amp;#39;re switched on please come to the animal Bas Gathering the location is where I live in Costa Rica it&amp;#39;ll all be hosted and I want good people there around me because I need Community also but I want people to understand that if you can move to the tropics you can solve the equation I realize for 95% of people listening to this podcast you can&amp;#39;t do that so the chicken light is an amazing thing because now when I&amp;#39;m traveling and of course people will laugh at it but look people have laughed at everyone who have tried who&amp;#39;s tried to step outside of the box I can put the chicken light right here I wish I had it with me and we could show people but I don&amp;#39;t I I will get content with this and we&amp;#39;ll put Boll into this podcast if you&amp;#39;re watching on YouTube because you can put the chicken light on a table and like you said you can get indoor full spectrum light it&amp;#39;s not there&amp;#39;s no UV in there is there there&amp;#39;s no not much UV I think there debatably could be a tiny tiny amount of UVA like okay I haven&amp;#39;t measured much of it but there&amp;#39;s visible and infrared so you can get some of that infrared back into your body during the day so this is what I wanted people to understand is if you&amp;#39;re working in an office you can do this now I realize guys that everyone in your office is going to make fun of you but if you hold strong and you say hey look you know well not necessarily again it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the 250 watt either this is it has to be the 250 watt you could just get a couple lamps and change your light bulbs with normal incandescence and just like this yeah we should have brought a bunch of lamps in here but um what I like about this is I think it&amp;#39;s pretty doable for people to switch to incandescent lighting I mean again this is what folks grew up on in you know the mid 20th century so it&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re saying to do something totally out outrageous we&amp;#39;re like let&amp;#39;s just go back to you know what we had for this reason and yeah I I think yeah if you want to get the 250 watt bulb and do therapy or just have that like I do my house looks kind of weird and yeah I have beeswax candles at night that&amp;#39;s a totally different story but just incandescent bulbs doable I think it&amp;#39;s very doable 100% doable and I think that a company there are companies that make red lights like this we talked about they have a red filter over but we were talking you might even want the red filter because you want the blue and the green you almost want and I&amp;#39;m sure a company can make an elegant cool looking lamp that wouldn&amp;#39;t stand out on your desk like my chicken lamp will and a company should do this I think maybe I&amp;#39;ll do it with one of my companies who knows we&amp;#39;ll just we&amp;#39;ll sell these chicken lamps in like a a pretty package that it can be on your desk when I was in residency in Seattle at the University of Washington some of my colleagues would have these the light boxes on their desk and they were full blue light sad lamps the sad lamps which don&amp;#39;t work by the way because if you look at the data like those lamps don&amp;#39;t work for Seasonal effective disorder you have to actually get UV and and be in real sunlight but the idea with the sad lamps was to somehow um actually entrain your circadian rhythm with a bright light in the morning because there&amp;#39;s no bright light outside in Seattle and your indoors I I think it could work from that perspective to where like it would give you like some stimulus in the morning but it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not fixing the problem and the problem is we&amp;#39;re indoor we&amp;#39;re getting no Inc or infrared light that&amp;#39;s the problem so I think this is a Time family conversation and why I pride myself being in Wyoming because you&amp;#39;re right you know it is easy to be healthier on the beach and in the tropics like it&amp;#39;s almost effortless you don&amp;#39;t even have to think about it you&amp;#39;re just Barefoot in the sun you have open houses you just come to Costa Rica guys you all the good people list come to Costa Rica but if you can&amp;#39;t do that I mean you can visit go hang out with Paul but if you&amp;#39;re just you know in the northeast or in the midwest like Rocky Mountains yeah winter is a challenge and guess what we spend why do we get more sick in Winter I think it&amp;#39;s because we spend more time endorse and we have less photonic energy so you have this massive shift in how you&amp;#39;re you know metabolizing everything because you have less photonic energy and then especially if you&amp;#39;re you know indoors all the time you&amp;#39;re getting no infrared light and just let me implore you can get outside wear layers infrared penetrates like five to 10 layers of clothing deep so you can have it on your desk it could even be under your desk yeah you could infrared your your junk guys and it it it gets it scatter matters really well in the environment and that&amp;#39;s why actually plants so really cool um and Scott Zimmerman talks about this a lot is the reason why we love like lush green environments and Costa Ria is a perfect example plants actually reflect green and infrared light so when we&amp;#39;re in like a really green environment we&amp;#39;re getting maybe even more of a percentage like 80 plus% of photons could be infrared light and that&amp;#39;s why we feel really good like Forest bathing obviously fresh air and ground if you&amp;#39;re",

so fixated on these closed loop SI systems of our bodies is like yeah it&amp;#39;s just the energy you eat and that&amp;#39;s it and it&amp;#39;s like no this is a very multifaceted equation of input signals and I&amp;#39;m an engineer I think about everything like like an engineer so all we need to do to improve the system of our body which if you want to improve the output which is vit ity it&amp;#39;s energy it&amp;#39;s mood it&amp;#39;s you know resilience you need to optimize the input signals and what are the input signals that we evolve to take in from nature it&amp;#39;s sun it&amp;#39;s local food it&amp;#39;s relationships it&amp;#39;s clean water it&amp;#39;s clean air but it&amp;#39;s the electromagnetic inputs and you know the physical biochemical inputs that are have been available to us for hundreds of thousands of years and millions of years as like all biological mamalian life and it&amp;#39;s that simple and I think eventually I think Brian is he&amp;#39;s changed his stance on some things and I hope he comes around because at the end of the day there is a balance between like modern living and you know natural living and I I&amp;#39;m excited to see how we can strike a good balance for people because you and I are probably far further on the spectrum of like Primal like feral living than most people are willing and don&amp;#39;t have the flexibility to do but yeah we could fix lighting like I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s even hard so easy um things that are more complicated are the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum and just how we use technology let&amp;#39;s talk about skin cancer a little more um because I don&amp;#39;t believe that this is an open and shut case I don&amp;#39;t believe that sunlight is actually clearly driving skin cancer in a healthy human and there&amp;#39;s a lot about this so you mentioned earlier a little bit about melan uh melanoma and blue light potentially in connection with melanoma I&amp;#39;ve spoken in the past about connections with seed oils and melanoma and we can talk about that as well there are three different types of skin cancer there&amp;#39;s squamous there&amp;#39;s basil and there&amp;#39;s melanoma there&amp;#39;s lots of evidence that low-level chronic sun exposure is protective against melanoma that is really not able to be divad that&amp;#39;s incontrovertible squamous and basil do seem to have connections with sunlight or at least light exposure maybe UV exposure but I think a lot of that this is my hypothesis is related to seed oils or is it also related to inadequate production of or inadequate nutrients in terms of infrared light so you mentioned something that I just want to highlight and it really a light bulb just went on my head that&amp;#39;s a bad pun right now it was unintended guys I apologize um that like the studies done on skin cancer are using only they&amp;#39;re using narrow Spectrum UV light that&amp;#39;s crazy especially when we&amp;#39;re learning now that the infrared wavelengths are essential for the production of intracellular melatonin in the in the total corporeal body pool which has an SPF which is an antioxidant which is certainly connected with epigenetics and protection from skin Cancers and so that&amp;#39;s wild like how can you claim that ultraviolet light causes skin cancer when you&amp;#39;re using it as a processed light and the parallel that I&amp;#39;m drawing in my mind is so many of the studies done with isolated fructose and I won&amp;#39;t get too far off the topic here but the idea is that when you give humans pure fructose which never occurs in nature or pure sucrose they get overgrowth of the bacteria in their gut and that causes dysbiosis and you get endotoxemia increase lip a polysaccharide and so this doesn&amp;#39;t happen when you give someone a fruit or honey which have a Whole Food&amp;#39;s Matrix they have all of the polyphenols thousands of other chemicals which actually prevent overgrowth of bacteria in our gut these these polyphenols these chemicals prevent the biosis and so sugar is bad for humans but not because of why we think it is sugar is bad for humans because it causes dispos and endotoxemia that&amp;#39;s the problem insulin induced insulin resistance that&amp;#39;s not the problem with sugar when you give someone a whole fruit it&amp;#39;s fine we can&amp;#39;t say that ultraviolet light is bad for humans in the context of a full light quote diet that&amp;#39;s crazy and it&amp;#39;s so interesting that the nutrients from the infrared light protect us from that and I wonder if I think squamous and basil are related to seed oil consumption because we know that the more polysaturated fats specifically linolic acid we eat the more it gets stored and it&amp;#39;s certainly stored in our dermis and epidermis and it&amp;#39;s certainly making our dermis and epidermis more susceptible to oxidative damage and so we have essentially two evolutionary inconsistencies here right we have excess amounts of linolic acid in our dermis and epidermis and we have evolutionarily inadequate infrared nutrient consumption in our lives we have malnutrition and Mal illumination yeah that&amp;#39;s what we have and yeah your spot on the the the research is it&amp;#39;s so myopic and it&amp;#39;s so much lacking context of how we would be exposed to these things in the real world and that&amp;#39;s like the biggest problem here and you know it&amp;#39;s a controversial topic but there have been studies like you know I was rereading this one book from John A and I think in the early 80s there was a study in Australia that showed that the increase the people who spent more time under fluorescent lighting had a higher incidence of melanoma compared to those who spend time outside and it makes sense right and the same paper we mentioned Scott zerman they talked about breast cancer cells I have written down here is that um blue light increases breast cancer cell growth rates uh 5 to 6X the tumor size in like 30 days but if you have the infrared there and you have melatonin production then that&amp;#39;s not going to be really an issue so it&amp;#39;s all about getting what you know would be available in a full you know Spectrum context both from food and from light and I think the other powerful uh study here and that and that&amp;#39;s why you know we can harp on epidemi epidemiology a lot right especially for food and things but for light emfs um actually sometimes a better option because they&amp;#39;re isolating these variables in the lab and it&amp;#39;s even you know a further stretch of the imagination like if you&amp;#39;re just testing UV or you&amp;#39;re just testing like one frequency and also what are the lab conditions probably going to be like this room or you know is is the Wi-Fi router on and all these things like EMF there&amp;#39;s a lot of variables from an electromagnetic spectrum perspective that are not being taken into account so in my opinion uh using these studies as like this is the end all be all is is not really indicative of the environment that we&amp;#39;re being exposed to these things at so the Swedish melanoma cohort is the one that I fought back to I think it&amp;#39;s like 2011 2012 lanquist maybe is the name of the researcher another Swedish name but they basically found that people who spent the most time in Sun in Sweden had the lowest incidence of melanoma and again uh you know there&amp;#39;s been more of that with like people who work outside right because all of these things is like you build up a solar cou and you&amp;#39;re getting the consistent sun exposure the infrared you&amp;#39;re building the melanin which is also an antioxidant amongst many other things in our body um as opposed to you know your average like City goer who&amp;#39;s in Blue Light all day they&amp;#39;re getting this you know in they&amp;#39;re getting no exposure to infrared light and then on the weekends they just go blast theirselves at the beach with you know UV exposure and Seed oils and you know they have oxidative stress like proliferating and they have nothing to help clean that up so it&amp;#39;s yeah I can see of course that that would then induce maybe any type of cancer and maybe just rear its head in melanoma potentially yeah you go to the beach so I love this I love this sort of um this this instance this example you&amp;#39;re suggesting this sort of Paradigm um where someone is in a office all day during the week then you might go to the beach on the weekends and you&amp;#39;re putting on sunscreens which are blocking the ultraviolet wavelengths but letting all of the high energy visible through so you&amp;#39;re actually like you&amp;#39;re actually suppressing the potential s like beneficial production of you know melanin and and protecting your skin that&amp;#39;s why you get sunburn because sunburn is telling your body oh it&amp;#39;s time to get out of you know the Sun and that&amp;#39;s you know again the researchers highlight is like sunscreen can be really detrimental because you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re like tricking your body and then you&amp;#39;re still getting all of the high energy blue and violet into your skin yeah deeper deeper as well wow cuz I know sunscreen is obviously harmful for humans because of the endocrine disrupting compounds the octob benzone oxybenzone avobenzone oxylate which are excreted in the poop in the P those are problematic for humans but this is an interesting thing that the these molecules which are aromatic molecules",

      "content": "oxybenzone avobenzone oxylate which are excreted in the poop in the P those are problematic for humans but this is an interesting thing that the these molecules which are aromatic molecules they do block these ultraviolet photons but like you&amp;#39;re saying these high energy visible wavelengths not being blocked you&amp;#39;re giving your your skin sort of confusing signals let&amp;#39;s talk about sunglasses for a minute because I think those are a confusing signal for your body also there must be a connection between visible light into your eyes supermatic nucleus paraventricular nucleus Superior cervical ganglia and your skin yeah yeah I mean it it all starts with light uh in the eyes and the eyes is the you know the predominant photo receptors are are in the eyes you can of course get whole body kind of signaling that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s happening and locally of course that&amp;#39;s why you get tan in certain areas uh when you have a shirt or you know you get tan lines but the the main signal is happening through your eyes so when you put on sunglasses in the middle of the day you are very much confusing your body because all of a sudden it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very dark it&amp;#39;s very dim um you&amp;#39;re you can suppress melanin production because the main you know stimulation of melanocytes it&amp;#39;s happening when you know the blue light or actually the UV is hitting your skin and your eyes and your body is you know it&amp;#39;s going through U Psy it&amp;#39;s called and I&amp;#39;m not an expert on these biological functions but it&amp;#39;s eventually stimulating Alpha msh which is stimulating melanoides melanin production which is protection and the same thing happens you know across the board but the eyes are the main window and the main input signal receptor for this light so it&amp;#39;s very confusing you can just use a logical perspective it&amp;#39;s very confusing for your body when you&amp;#39;re in I don&amp;#39;t know it could be uv10 uv2 like very high UV environment but the main input signal of your body is is is now dim and dark and it&amp;#39;s only blocked in UV and then guess what it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not always blocking the the high energy visible wavelength either so you&amp;#39;re yeah it&amp;#39;s uh it it&amp;#39;s not to me conducive to getting the optimal environment however I will say if you&amp;#39;re like on a mountain or or on a boat you get a different light spectrum because there&amp;#39;s a lot of reflection of the UV off water and off snow maybe that&amp;#39;s a time you need sunglasses um but really people think that they need them because they&amp;#39;re so sensitive to the light so it&amp;#39;s like why do they feel like it they need to wear sunglasses cuz they&amp;#39;re so sensitive because they never spend a lot of time outside in Full Spectrum Lighting and they&amp;#39;re not getting that you know natural rise in terms of the the photon density and the higher energy wavelengths by being outside from the morning onwards and it&amp;#39;s also a testament right like when you are indoors like the moment we walk out of this studio we are both going to be like oh wow it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s bright outside because even though these lights seem very bright in here an indoor environment is around like 500 maybe a th000 lux at most a bright outdoor sunny day could be over 100,000 Lux so we&amp;#39;re talking like a 100 to a,x difference in the brightness and brightness is just a measure of photon density which is a measure of energy density so that&amp;#39;s how much energy we&amp;#39;re leaving on the table by being indoors all the time and of course we&amp;#39;re not going to be used to that and yeah like again I keep coming back to John a because he had all these revelations in like 70s and 80s and he found that you know people really did better healing he had some you know Fringe studies that were done and probably aren&amp;#39;t credible in in standard practice but you know he told people go outside as much as possible never wear sunglasses never wear glasses because you need that input signal not being distorted anything that&amp;#39;s going to distort the solar spectrum is going to confuse your biology so how are you going to be able to optimize for that environment if you&amp;#39;re getting this distorted input and that&amp;#39;s where we are sunglasses are [ __ ] yes every time I see my friends with these I mean I saw my friend he was recently in Egypt and I&amp;#39;ll call him out when he comes on the podcast I saw Brigham you know he was in Egypt I said Brigham sunglasses are [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t understand why people are wearing sunglasses and you know my buddy who I&amp;#39;m traveling in Texas with right now has uh some fancy I forget what kind of sunglasses they are in his car and I was like man these are [ __ ] he&amp;#39;s like I just wear them to look cool it&amp;#39;s like yeah okay but understand and I feel like there&amp;#39;s a use case for sunglasses i&amp;#39; I I used to do mountaining when I lived in Jackson Hall and you had Glacier goggles right when you&amp;#39;re skiing on a sunny day I have to have goggles right I have to have goggles on a boat in Costa Rica reflection off the sun of the sun off the ocean yeah you need these but just walking around a look cool in Beverly Hills or New York or wherever no doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense the crazy thing is people wear the when it&amp;#39;s like cloudy and damn and I&amp;#39;m like no that is like you don&amp;#39;t need those and again we&amp;#39;re going back to there&amp;#39;s a lot of you know correlative highlevel population studies that&amp;#39;s saying brighter days darker nights all Call&amp;#39;s mortality is you know 30 40% higher when you do the opposite of that at the extremes of these studies and that&amp;#39;s what you are just putting on you know dim days like you are you are fully embracing the opposite of what you want and that&amp;#39;s detrimental to circadian Health it&amp;#39;s detrimental to the entire Cascade of system so if you want to live a long time from a light perspective like we said Bright Days Dark Nights not the opposite you not want Dark Days and bright nights which is what we&amp;#39;re living in now I mean we&amp;#39;re living In Perpetual dullness we&amp;#39;re living in what&amp;#39;s crazy is you say it&amp;#39;s yeah maybe it&amp;#39;s dull days Dark Nights it is in terms of like comparison sake but it&amp;#39;s really the same there is no cyclicality to like human living we&amp;#39;re in Endless Summer metabolism you know people are eating like all this food whatever all the time",

care if you guys are in the Bitcoin guys I just think it&amp;#39;s a fascinating thing it&amp;#39;s an analogy that I use a lot so I apologize if you guys are not familiar with Bitcoin but that that to me is interesting so I think that&amp;#39;s one of the ways that excess lenic acid from seed oils causes that problem potentially they&amp;#39;re high in dyum we&amp;#39;ll talk about that as well but yeah there&amp;#39;s a lot of parallels there between the light and the seed oils causing problems with our immacula the the retinal pigmented epithelium of our eyes and our skin it&amp;#39;s all connected and Seed oils are definitely a part of all this yeah and I think and skin cancer yeah and mondri dysfunction I mean the mondra for me is where everything comes down to cuz like that&amp;#39;s where the most important biological functions going it&amp;#39;s energy it&amp;#39;s communication and guess what it&amp;#39;s the most electromagnetic area of our biology it&amp;#39;s quite literally like using electrons energy to create this proton gradient which is voltage to pump a nanomotor and yeah like that&amp;#39;s why I want to emphasize these electromagnetic inputs of our environment including light including emfs they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re vastly important and that&amp;#39;s why we see so much mitochondrial dysfunction and why it&amp;#39;s such a problem is the mitochondrial DNA mut Ates like 5 to 10 times maybe even 20 times faster than the nuclear genome H because it has to be so adaptive to the environment right like there&amp;#39;s this adaptive nature to it which is a good thing because you know we can be resilient in terms of different light environments and different seasons and different temperatures and uncoupling and all that you mentioned proton leak sometimes that can be a good thing in the cold when you produce uh more heat uh but in general that also is when you&amp;#39;re in a toxic environment and have this dysfunction that that can proliferate mutations and then you actually pass that down like generation on generation hoplas heteroplasia and we see you know uh Scott zerman talked about autism in this paper and how like um you know blue light can increase mcp1 proteins or something that an infrared can combat that but what I&amp;#39;ve seen is all of these issues autism and you know just neurodevelopment issues at younger chronic disease in general younger and younger ages is because we&amp;#39;re proliferating this mitochondrial dysfunction generation on generation so if you&amp;#39;re you know about to be a parent or you&amp;#39;re nursing mother uh you really want to think about that because you want to get your mitochondri as healthy as possible and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an uphill battle because the food is toxic that is creating dysfunction the light uh we have malnutrition Mal illumination and then we have all these other inputs that you know we&amp;#39;ll get to and the tech crisis is is real let&amp;#39;s talk about devices let&amp;#39;s start with flicker so why I said one of the reasons that I think just this is my idea but who knows that that light at the restaurant was so harmful because I could feel it flickering and when I went into the store in in Austin I could feel the light flickering so people may not know this but all of these lights I mean these blue lights were under right now the lights in your house definitely fluorescent lights they might even be able to sense it your phone display your computer display they are flickering on and off this LED bulb was flickering on and off um what&amp;#39;s the problem here yes so the nature of LEDs and fluorescent lights flicker as well for for different reasons um because floresent are fascinating they&amp;#39;re actually like it&amp;#39;s mercury vapor bulb and then they use like phosphor Coatings to to move the Spectrum around but I think they&amp;#39;re actually the worst form of lighting because the mercury vapor lines are super isolated we&amp;#39;re talking like a line like 5 nanometers like wide it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s nothing it&amp;#39;s just a very it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just like a super high Spike and that&amp;#39;s flickering uh tremendously but for which is most lighting nowadays the problem is that the driver the LED driver itself uses an Electronics control method called pulse with modulation other otherwise known as pwm and this has become the standard uh for electronics design and what is is happening is is basically it&amp;#39;s more advantageous when you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re changing in brightness to use this pwm control from an Electronics perspective so that&amp;#39;s become the standard and yeah they are in a sense turning on and off they&amp;#39;re cycling the amplitude of the brightness at such a fast rate that it&amp;#39;s above our visual perception so we can only see flicker around 60 to 90 Hertz which Hertz is you know um the amount of oscillations per second so 60 to 90 times per second we can still like visually see that if it&amp;#39;s above it we can&amp;#39;t see it but our brain and our eyes can feel it they they are stressed by it and this is also something that it&amp;#39;s not really up for debate there&amp;#39;s itle e 1789 itle e is the Institute of electrical and electronic engineers and they have this code and right in the code it says flickering lights and LEDs can cause ice strain migraines headaches it aggravates symptoms of autism because it&amp;#39;s you know you know a negative stimulus it can induce epileptic episodes which most people you probably make sense that that could happen it can induce anxi xiety and potentially panic attacks so this is Flicker and I think I sent you a more detailed outline as well that you know goes into some some depths of of studies but it&amp;#39;s really undebatable that flicker is a problem but all lights in our environment are pretty much flickering sunlight is never you know sunlight is purely continuous so it&amp;#39;s just another stressor on top of this you know toxic cake that we&amp;#39;re exposed to on a daily basis and in my opinion I&amp;#39;ve noticed firsthand as someone you know who&amp;#39;s dealt with like postconcussive syndrome and symptoms for a long time that flicker almost bothers me more than the light spectrum itself because it&amp;#39;s just constantly there and it&amp;#39;s are you know imagine someone&amp;#39;s just tapping you on the shoulder like constantly like you&amp;#39;re never going to not be on edge it&amp;#39;s really activating a sympathetic nervous system activating that&amp;#39;s what I noticed that&amp;#39;s what everyone is in this really stressed out state for multiple reasons and I think flicker uh in the indoor lighting environment and the screens that we&amp;#39;re looking at all day are a big reason for that and it&amp;#39;s so frustrating because it it just doesn&amp;#39;t have to be that way like it we could get rid of Flicker and I bet you nobody would notice it would be you know an engineering effort to do so and you know companies would be pissed but like we don&amp;#39;t need that why would we have something that&amp;#39;s purposefully stressing our biology out all day long and I think that&amp;#39;s a big reason when you&amp;#39;re looking at screens all day that you feel so fatigued I strain everything at the end of the day this is my subjective appraisal but that my subjective experience is that I&amp;#39;m under those flickering lights at the restaurant and I don&amp;#39;t sleep well I have a little trouble going to sleep my sleep feels Restless I wake up early I sleep much better when I strictly control my light environment in the four to five hours before I go to sleep hopefully these blue LEDs at this podcast we&amp;#39;re podcasting from 9:00 a.m. to noon today",

really affect me later in the day we&amp;#39;ll go to Barton Springs we&amp;#39;ll jump in I&amp;#39;ll be outside for the rest of the day as much as I possibly can to try and undo this I noticed in my house in Costa Rica that when I was doing podcast with blue light in my studio there in the afternoons that it would affect my sleep negatively maybe I&amp;#39;m more sensitive than other people but I think a lot of humans are experiencing this and we&amp;#39;re not aware I heard someone say once you don&amp;#39;t have an insomnia problem you have an artificial light problem and I think this cannot be overemphasized that the light environment the light that you are consuming is critical for the quality of your sleep and anyone listening to this podcast must know the quality of your sleep is the foundation upon which you walk in a day I can feel significantly smarter or less smart in a day if I&amp;#39;ve slept well or badly it&amp;#39;s just like nutrition I think sleep and nutrition and light are the three pillars of healthy human existence and really until I started thinking about this with you recently I would have said sleep and nutrition without as much attention to light granted I was living in Costa Rica and I didn&amp;#39;t have to think about it as much but when I&amp;#39;m traveling I have to think about it much more about sleep nutrition and light and we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;ve talked about we&amp;#39;ll definitely talk about nutrition and light in this podcast specifically but the flickering lights I cannot fix it I went to the restaurant I even had blue light blocking glasses on at this restaurant looking like a goober over there in the corner eating my grass-fed steak I don&amp;#39;t care I don&amp;#39;t care like I want to sleep well I want to show up good the next day for everyone in my life to do work in the world I don&amp;#39;t care and it doesn&amp;#39;t help and so flickering lights are a big deal I also think that my suspicion and you may be able to speak to this is that flickering lights on phones and devices keep us addicted because it&amp;#39;s very hard to look away from flickering things and we can talk about daylight and the tablet and your experiences with this because my niece and nephew so my mom my their grandmother bought them I iPads for Christmas a few years ago and I kind of just did the face poem and thought that&amp;#39;s a horrible idea they came to visit me in Costa Rica last January and they throw Tantrums when you try and take away their iPad whether it&amp;#39;s the blue light there&amp;#39;s something incredibly dop and energic about flickering blue light Rich screens for children and I&amp;#39;m sure that it&amp;#39;s harming them I&amp;#39;m sure that it&amp;#39;s harming them and I&amp;#39;ve heard you and Ann from from daylight say that when you try and take this tablet the daylight tablet which we&amp;#39;ll talk about later in the podcast which doesn&amp;#39;t Flicker and you can control the blue on you can control the blue light on this tablet away from a kid they don&amp;#39;t lose their [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s so interesting so maybe we could can we measure the flicker on my phone yeah yeah one of the Articles you sent me we&amp;#39;ll put it in the in the description light emitting diode lighting flicker its impact on health and the need to minimize it it&amp;#39;s 2019 study um and uh yeah obviously flicker is not good so light emitting diodes are LEDs and I think it&amp;#39;s one of the most underrated ones this like people are aware that blue light exists and you know that it could potentially disrupt sleep but I no one I didn&amp;#39;t really talk about flicker until you know you know what we&amp;#39;re doing at daylight but I realized quickly that it was such a problem so yeah um just measured Paul&amp;#39;s screen and the frequency of flicker on his iPhone is is 480 H Hertz so that means 480 times a second it is kind of changing in amplitude it&amp;#39;s oscillating and the percent flicker here is you know 48% which isn&amp;#39;t horrible it&amp;#39;s you know I&amp;#39;ve seen worse and what do you mean the percent flicker so it&amp;#39;s just a measure of kind of there&amp;#39;s two measures of flicker there&amp;#39;s percent Flicker and flicker index so depending on what you&amp;#39;re doing um what brightness setting you&amp;#39;re at and what you know kind of device that you have those numbers could change the higher the percentage so if it&amp;#39;s like 90 something percent the worse it is and the flicker index the same thing if the higher it is the the worse off it is so 50% it&amp;#39;s actually not horrible but it depends on what brightness and device you have but from my readings historically and we&amp;#39;ve talked about this I found the phone to be far worse than a laptop for for example and it seems like the laptop tops are using much higher rates and frequencies which typically uh I think the the worst spot to be is like in this 120 to uh 500 Hertz range whereas if you keep going higher you eventually get a point where it&amp;#39;s flickering so fast so your brain is not registering it as much so yeah your laptop is at 15 khz 15,000 Hertz right so that&amp;#39;s ulating much faster and the flicker rate&amp;#39;s higher it&amp;#39;s actually 83% but it seems I would say because it&amp;#39;s oscillating so fast it almost almost gets treated as like a DC current a direct like non my eyes and my brain by your eyes and like it eventually becomes so fast your brain can no longer perceive it so I think the dangerous window is the phones which are in like the hundreds of Hertz range and that&amp;#39;s anecdotally I can look at my MacBook way longer than I can look at my phone and I think it&amp;#39;s a combination of the size and the flicker I think that to me are the two things because again we&amp;#39;re talking about how how bad myopia is how unnatural it is to look at like a 5 in screen all day like also few inches in front of you the most important concept to know about electromagnetic waves which is light which is emfs is distance is the most important thing the distance from The Source because if you put 2x distance from you in the source you&amp;#39;re two square which is 4X reducing the field intensity so you&amp;#39;re getting a higher intensity field of the light if you know you&amp;#39;re holding your phone really yeah it&amp;#39;s all R squ inverse Square law whereas the the computer is a broader screen so it&amp;#39;s kind of more spread out has lower flick well technically higher flicker rate but in my opinion lower flicker um in terms of its effect on you and then it&amp;#39;s further away so I think",

      "content": "they have a negative relationship with their devices and and let&amp;#39;s just contextualize it right you mentioned Vegas I was just in Vegas I think it&amp;#39;s a perfect example I almost go there for like inspiration for like marketing right our our modern device Suite especially our phones they are mini casinos right because what what do they do what is modern technology do yeah because Vegas they block out all the natural light they put you fully inside they have all these bright flashing lights so bright colors flashing lights they have you know alcohol they pump it with oxygen and they you know have girls walk around with not that many clothes on right so they they design the environment so that you are addicted to the game when you sit down you cannot get up and of course the game itself has a dopaminergic component to it but it&amp;#39;s the full holistic environmental design that&amp;#39;s really so hard to you know stay away from even me I&amp;#39;m walking through the hotel and I&amp;#39;m like man like this is Lighting on my brain and that&amp;#39;s what your phone is doing what do they do well it keeps you inside so you&amp;#39;re in not in natural sunlight you&amp;#39;re not Outdoors you&amp;#39;re in an artificial environment uh then you have the hardware itself which is high and blue heavy flickering light um and then you have the actual game the software itself so everyone thinks it&amp;#39;s just the game it&amp;#39;s the whole design it&amp;#39;s the component I think the form factor itself of a phone is really underrated and how addicting it is like you don&amp;#39;t scroll on your laptop it&amp;#39;s just no one does that it&amp;#39;s kind of harder even an iPad or like a tablet form factor you can scroll but it&amp;#39;s a bit it&amp;#39;s a bit different so I ask people well what if Vegas was what if the casinos were outside and you know there wasn&amp;#39;t all these bright flashing lights and that&amp;#39;s what you know we&amp;#39;re trying to do at daylight that&amp;#39;s our thing it&amp;#39;s like what if the technology was less like a casino and more just you know a tool for your environment to get work done so that you can actually like enjoy your life and not have all the negative detriment and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s tough because our threshold for dopamine has been so altered by you know these modern technological devices and just instant access to everything and convenience at the highest level so we do have a challenge in that sense but I think people are ready for it I think people are aware that I mean iPad kids is Lally a meme on Tik toks it&amp;#39;s I didn&amp;#39;t know oh yeah if you have kids like parents know that screens are bad they&amp;#39;re outlying like California has outlawed phones in schools which when I I grew up right when smartphones came out in high school and no one you you weren&amp;#39;t allowed to use your phone in class but apparently it&amp;#39;s gotten so bad to where it&amp;#39;s banned now so the timing is right but there&amp;#39;s no Alternatives that exist it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really inconvenient to change anything so what I do is similar to what you do is I try and use my phone the least I possibly can do all my work on my MacBook and my daylight computer and then when I do have my phone I yeah do the red screen filters I try and set timers for certain things and I try and do as much work in a good environment as possible like good proper light um but yeah I think the flicker the blue light it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s stressing your body out so then you&amp;#39;re going to be more susceptible to be sucked in to the social media to the Doom scrolling because you&amp;#39;re just you know you&amp;#39;re less resilient you&amp;#39;re kind of like getting punched in the face and then you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re like all right we got we got you down so everyone could be a bit more resilient but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s damn hard because we&amp;#39;re just being assaulted by so many different dire and they&amp;#39;re good at it their business model is keeping you on device longer that is the algorithm that is all you know they have to do they have to keep growing they have to be you know beholding to their shareholders and they have to keep pumping out new products and make more money how do they do that they do that by keeping you on device on screen in app longer and that needs to change it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s Sinister it&amp;#39;s nefarious and people I just want people to realize that that your device is not there to make your life easier your device is there to keep you addicted to it and and when the founders of these companies don&amp;#39;t let their kids have it until they&amp;#39;re 14 or 16 years old they understand the dangers and they&amp;#39;re trying to get you to give it to your kids eyew watches I mean I wish we had an iPad in here have you ever checked the flicker on an iPad I haven&amp;#39;t I I wonder let&amp;#39;s find some an iPad yeah and we we&amp;#39;ll put it in like the description or something we can put a little we&amp;#39;ll do some content about it it&amp;#39;s probably similar to an iPhone I bet it is I bet it is the other thing that I do specifically with my phone is I try to use it on grayscale or I will use it on the filter during the day because when I use it on the red filter during the day I am much less likely to use it when it&amp;#39;s like this it&amp;#39;s much less pleasing to look at when I&amp;#39;m on the full blue mode it almost looks like pieces of candy and I I think the Instagram icon is designed to look like a piece of candy or something this is this is recapitulating our visual perception of ripe fruit the visual Instinct that I get with an Instagram icon is that&amp;#39;s a piece of ripe fruit I&amp;#39;m going to click on that I want that I mean there&amp;#39;s a bunch of ripe fruit here on my iPhone that&amp;#39;s like a tree full of ripe berries you can&amp;#39;t look away but when I click to the red or the gray scale it&amp;#39;s much less interesting and I could just go on do what I need to do and I&amp;#39;m much less likely to put it down and I think and I probably research about this that this has less of an effect on dopamine in my brain and so if you want to use your phone on grayscale like just understand that these devices are meant to addict us I actually do that with my computer also because I will find that sometimes with the colors on my computer I I spend more time on it than I should I want I love what you said I hadn&amp;#39;t thought about that before like I want the computer to be a means to an end I want it to be much less interesting than going outside I want it to be better than picking my nose better than just hanging out and doing nothing I can do work on it but I don&amp;#39;t want it to pull me in and so I don&amp;#39;t want my computer to be visually intriguing unless I&amp;#39;m trying to watch a movie or something artistic in which point I could put on uh a certain filter and get like the full colors but I don&amp;#39;t want my computer to be so colorful so I will use Iris in sleep mode during the day um one thing that I thought about that I just wanted to mention circling back to what we were saying earlier some people because of the strain they&amp;#39;re getting from looking at their computer they&amp;#39;re using like yellow glasses during the day when they&amp;#39;re looking at their computer do you think this is harmful because then you&amp;#39;re blocking blue light during the day so what you&amp;#39;d want to do I think what you might want to do is get a better computer get something that&amp;#39;s flickering less use less blue light on your computer the ideal I think would be to not use blue light blocking glasses even when you&amp;#39;re looking at your computer I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve never done that and I don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s tough right you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re in like a lose lose situation so it is tough and you know I I know people that do that and like I sort of understand but I think the better solution is yeah maybe you shift the screen to be a little like my screens are always like a little orange during the day and then red at night as well like I do need to see to some degree but the best thing is improve the light environment around you like we talked about so that you&amp;#39;re balancing out the blue as opposed to blocking it and then you&amp;#39;re kind of confusing your body as well but yeah um there&amp;#39;s not like a ton of research but it&amp;#39;s pretty OB obvious that blue light is more dopaminergic it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s why is that because wakefulness dopamine that&amp;#39;s like dopamine is like reward seeking Behavior people think they have a kind of a distorted opinion and huin actually does a good job explaining this and like the basic level is that you know that&amp;#39;s going to motivate us to like go and do something whereas now we&amp;#39;re getting that from our devices and it&amp;#39;s like motivating us to just keep clicking and C keep scrolling whereas the blue light from the sun is like all right go out hear some energy and simulation and wakefulness girl go meet a girl go hunt an animal go look for go jump in a river yeah go climb a tree do something outside and it&amp;#39;s really a problem and and that&amp;#39;s our whole ethos CU people are like oh what&amp;#39; you make a boring iPad you made a colorless you know tablet it&amp;#39;s like yeah we want the color to be in the real world in your real life it&amp;#39;s a tragedy that kids are growing up they have access to all the information you could learn anything today you could become an expert in anything you could go in any direction that&amp;#39;s the benefit of technology and we&amp;#39;re doing stuff like this you and I researched all this independently but what do most people end up doing they end up scrolling on Instagram scrolling on Tik Tok and then they consume all of this unbelievable content and what does that make the real life look like it makes it look very gray because they dopamine uh has just been desensitized so then you have all these mental health issues and then they just want to stay inside more and then you get the whole Rabbit Hole of repercussions that results from that and it&amp;#39;s a tragedy it&amp;#39;s a problem but it&amp;#39;s such An Inconvenient Truth with barely any alternatives so yeah we have a big you know task ahead of us and I&amp;#39;m excited to try and at least get as many people over to this and I think the timing is right and I think people are waking up to this I think people I think people that that appreciate it will love it you know let&amp;#39;s talk about EMF so we got a good one I forgot my tinfoil hat you know we have to put on our tinfoil hats to talk about EMF but I mean you&amp;#39;re the guy talk to about this you know an electrical engineer like there&amp;#39;s no [ __ ] here this is physics this is science this is frustrating for me as an aside you know uh Zuckerberg recently came out said they&amp;#39;re going to be fact checking Less on Instagram even though I did a reel on seed oils and it got fact checked yet again on Instagram um I&amp;#39;ve done reels on EMF looking at a microwave we&amp;#39;ve spoken about microwaves in connection with airpods so this is the last or this is another aspect of our devices right my phone is on airplane mode right now but the majority of time when I&amp;#39;m using using it it&amp;#39;s either getting cellular data or it&amp;#39;s on Wi-Fi my computer&amp;#39;s on Wi-Fi all of these devices are emitting an RF EMF let&amp;#39;s talk about EMF electromagnetic fields what are we exposed to let&amp;#39;s talk about RF versus EF and like how harmful is it how do we mitigate it what what are we thinking about here yeah let&amp;#39;s try and paint this picture so that people can relate to it and I think what I like to start with did you bring your meter also for that cool we&amp;#39;ll check some stuff I like I think people do need to understand that at the lowest level we are electromagnetic beings and we just talked about about mitochondria and how it&amp;#39;s literally like a battery SLC capacitor powering a nanomotor that&amp;#39;s you know the energy source and communication hub for all of biology some people might not even grasp that what do we use to measure our heart activity or brain activity in a hospital electrocardiograms electron srams what do we use to find tumors and torn ACLs magnetic resonance imaging which is putting your body in a stat a very strong static magnetic field and then pulsing a radio frequency so that it kind of reflects uh back from the protons and water molecules and that&amp;#39;s how we get images so there is some agreement that electromagnetism and our biology is vitally important and this might be how it&amp;#39;s functioning at the lowest level and of course it is because it is all based on you know electrons and photons and interactions and protons that&amp;#39;s what I mean chemistry is based on like electron interactions right so this is where I think like physics is missing from mainstream education in the medical system and I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s because you know the flexner report or the evolution of medicine and pharmaceuticals or it&amp;#39;s just like how it evolv but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter just like do I know if blue light was deliberately you know implemented through some MK Ultra activity I don&amp;#39;t know it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what matters is there&amp;#39;s a gap and we need to address it and everyone could probably agree that our medical field our in general education system and how we kind of think about science is very siloed and we need to become more multi-disciplinary because everything in nature is interconnected it&amp;#39;s an open system so the electromagnetic spectrum is vast and we already talked about a good amount of it is light and what most people don&amp;#39;t understand is EMF some radio frequency electrical power is also light it&amp;#39;s just light that we can no longer see it&amp;#39;s the same exact thing it&amp;#39;s photons that comprise of an electric field and a magnetic field uh oscillating you know in Phase 90° apart but at different frequencies and different wave lengths and thus different energy and far lower energy and the main argument you always get especially from people like electrical engineers and physicists is nonionizing radiation does not affect biology the RF EMF is yeah yeah RF electrical power they&amp;#39;re both you know nonionizing but also you know what else is non-ionizing the entire visible and infrared Spectrum but they affect our biology uh as we just discussed for a while in in quite a significant manner now I will say the visible spectrum uh predominantly affects our biology in a way that you know is important to understand is like electron excitation so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re stimulating they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re raising uh electron to a higher you know orbital or energy and that excitation is is impacting our biology because there&amp;#39;s enough energy um from the visible spectrum of light for that to occur and actually from like a quantum physics perspective has to match exactly now radio frequencies electrical power elf they don&amp;#39;t have enough energy to do that so it is a different mechanism but I like to just start there and get people understanding it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not just about that if it was just about the energy and frequency then none of this stuff you know would would really matter and there wouldn&amp;#39;t be thousands and thousands of studies but before we get to that also want to say you already mentioned that Steve Job Bill Gates Whoever these guys have been very cautious about letting their kids use technology now is that because of the light or is it because of the emfs and it&amp;#39;s maybe it&amp;#39;s both but they obviously knew something and what&amp;#39;s crazy and I sent I think I sent you this but there&amp;#39;s a manufacturing warning label on all technology so if you look it up your iPhone has a manufacturing warning label that says never hold this on your body always use five or 10 or 15 mm like 1 cm of of separation and that&amp;#39;s cons this is the manufacturer telling you this so that&amp;#39;s suspicious right well they never publicly talk about that and of course it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re covering you know their ass for any potential lawsuits because what&amp;#39;s the most important thing about electromagnetic waves and Fields is distance distance of separation and you have the highest power intensity exposure at a very short distance distances but I I want to then get into so you should be concerned if you go to like a cell tower of course they will also you know have signs everywhere then people only say oh well it&amp;#39;s only a thermal effect and that&amp;#39;s super high power which is true but there is quite literally and you&amp;#39;ve heard people like RFK say this on on Rogan it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s thousands and thousands of studies so we don&amp;#39;t have time to talk about thousands of studies I could literally go on Twitter and post one study every day for the next 10 years probably and this is nothing new there&amp;#39;s been a debate about emfs for decades and there&amp;#39;s been controversy",

there&amp;#39;s been controversy there&amp;#39;s been muddying of the water through like industry funded studies and obviously today this is the most Inconvenient Truth possible and I&amp;#39;m not going to lie there is things you can do to mitigate exposure drastically but there isn&amp;#39;t really a good solution like Wireless technology is inherently just a problem that hasn&amp;#39;t been solved but no one has even attempted to solve it and that&amp;#39;s you know what I&amp;#39;m passionate about but I always like to start people say show me the studies or something there&amp;#39;s this researcher named Dr Henry Li from the University of Washington he&amp;#39;s retired now but he still keeps this collection of research up to date and has over 2500 studies in it and he basically summarizes the results and I&amp;#39;ll just read you a couple of them but he basically breaks it down into you know radio frequency and extremely low frequency and different you know end effects of them and pretty much across the board around 90% of these studies show harmful biological effects so I I&amp;#39;ll just read a couple it&amp;#39;s like 89% of 384 studies looking at radio frequency on oxidative effects or free radicals um in in biology produce significant negative effects and 96% of those showed them far below uh the you know specific absorption rate which is a threshold a safety threshold which we can talk about how inadequate safety thresholds are and um far below the you know standard cuz people will say oh it&amp;#39;s only like high power density or really high amount of EMF exposure and that&amp;#39;s not true and then you can go on like 84% of 3508 studies looking at reproductive um effects showed negative effects 95% of low intensity across the board showed significant effects and then extremely low frequency we&amp;#39;re talking about like power uh electrical power power which is 50 60 hertz like 90% at oxidative stress uh studies showed significant effects 84% showed genetic effects of 200 studies 91% um of static even magnetic fields showed significant effects so we&amp;#39;re talking like hundreds and hundreds of studies and to me it&amp;#39;s it it&amp;#39;s at a points undebatable and that&amp;#39;s only going back to let&amp;#39;s see the early 9s some of these like the late 90s and if you&amp;#39;ve read some of the work from people like Robert Ocker Andrew Marino in the&amp;#39; 60s 7s &amp;#39; 80s actually it was when the government the Navy and Military was funding a lot of This research and they found a lot of negative effects as well so you have this kind of overwhelming body of evidence that people are just always dismissed for whatever reason it&amp;#39;s always oh it&amp;#39;s only Rodin or it&amp;#39;s epidemiological or we need you know updated studies and they&amp;#39;ve never even looked at things like 5G really they just rolled out the technology and same thing with 4G and 3G before then before properly studying it and based on just understanding what already exists in these specific frequencies uh because a lot of them are very similar uh you could easily make the conclusion that this is not safe or this should be treated with Extreme Caution right we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re quite literally just jumping into the deep end with no care in the world it&amp;#39;s like jumping in like a pool full of s and just assuming that they&amp;#39;re not going to bite you or not have a biological effect and it&amp;#39;s it it&amp;#39;s crazy because the safety standards are inadequate RFK and the Children&amp;#39;s Health defense has successfully sued the FCC for failing to update their guidelines on wireless technology because they haven&amp;#39;t updated it since 1996 this the year I was born that&amp;#39;s before Wi-Fi that&amp;#39;s before all modern like you know Wireless technology and they have the same safety standards and that&amp;#39;s based on more shoddy research from like decades before where they quite literally took the level of thermal effect because the whole argument is it&amp;#39;s just heating the cells it&amp;#39;s only a thermal effect so at this power density I think it was like 100 Ms per centim squared you will not be able to any longer deal with the heating effect and it&amp;#39;ll be a problem all right we&amp;#39;re going to use a factor of 10 so they took on10th of that number that was the safety threshold they started with and then they&amp;#39;ve modified it a little bit but not much but it&amp;#39;s all a thermal effect and it has and there&amp;#39;s no no attention to any of these subcellular processes that we talked about or oxidative stress DNA damage that the studies are potentially showing nothing no one&amp;#39;s looking at this because I get the same thing when I post about this I took an RF EMF meter and just people understand there&amp;#39;s ellf which is very low frequency EXT frequency and there&amp;#39;s RF which is radio frequency and what&amp;#39;s the radio frequency band so yeah let&amp;#39;s talk about that cuz it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of complicated the the the electrom electromagnetic spectrum is vast right and again the only difference here is the the wavelength and the frequency and the energy of the the wavelength radio frequency could be anywhere technically from like 100 khz which is like 100,000 uh Cycles or oscillations per second up to I mean 5G is let&amp;#39;s call it 100 gigahertz which is 100 billion cycles oscillations per second uh where we&amp;#39;re operating now is is 3G communication is around like 750 to 1,000 megahertz which is 750 million to um a billion cycles per second uh Wi-Fi is at 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gahz so 2.4 or 5 billion oscillations per second and 3G or sorry 5G is pushing that level higher um six uh 6 gigahertz is like the mid frequency band and I can explain 5G in dep in depth because it&amp;#39;s really confusing because there&amp;#39;s three different frequency bands which 5 operates in and most people were scared about millimeter waves which is like 30 GHz or above so much higher frequency than ever before and that&amp;#39;s what we have at the airports right yes so yeah 5G has three frequency Brands low low band midband and high band the high band is known as millimeter wave and that&amp;#39;s again what everyone&amp;#39;s freaking out about because it&amp;#39;s super high frequency which means higher energy um and that&amp;#39;s why you know this whole infrastructure changed because we never before have used this level of frequency and you anything in terms of uh radio wave transmission you have to redo if you change the frequency you have to redo the antennas and transceivers and the size of the antenna correlates to the frequency that you&amp;#39;re transmitting which is also important because that means every single like different wavelength and frequency we use potentially have a different biological effect because there&amp;#39;s tons of different molecules ranging in size and their diameters and I mean human resonance I I mentioned the you know safety thresholds the only time they like lowered the safety threshold was for the FM Radio band because at FM radio wavelength or sorry frequency it&amp;#39;s around 100 megahertz which the wavelength is 6 feet which is the size of a human body so by no with no scientific evidence at all they purely were like well that could be a concern because we know the antenna resonance effect is real we&amp;#39;re going to lower the safety threshold uh make it more strict for 100 mahz so FM radio but for anything below that um and kind of above it we&amp;#39;re going to we&amp;#39;re going to raise it up and make it less strict because then it can have a biological effect so that that&amp;#39;s a true story it can&amp;#39;t have a biological effect because the wavelength like the they they were like well if it doesn&amp;#39;t have an antenna resonance effect and it&amp;#39;s not thermal then they can&amp;#39;t have a biological effect so yeah so the radio frequency spectrum is vast and millimeter wave 5G um the benefit to 5G is these higher frequencies uh they have terrible range uh so they only travel very short distances that&amp;#39;s why they had to install all this new infrastructure and all these repeater Towers everywhere because the you know higher data throughput and everything you get from going to this higher frequency is a trade-off with the transmission distance because it drops out so fast at these higher frequencies so they can really only have them in big cities airports like down downtown areas entertainment centers that&amp;#39;s really where millimeter waves have been rolled out so if you&amp;#39;re in a rural place like you&amp;#39;re never going to be exposed to 5G millimeter waves and you probably never will and you&amp;#39;ll probably never have to worry about 6G or anything either because if they keep going up in frequency they have to put the repeaters closer and closer together and it&amp;#39;s not worth the investment in like a low population area right and 5G in general is far more like targeted so 3G 4G is kind of like omnidirectional the fact that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s blasting out these waves like in almost all Direction whereas 5G is far more targeted it has a narrow beam width and uses crazy things like beam steering and um just more advanced uh you know uh radio frequency um design for the wave so it&amp;#39;s far more engineered as well which is which is a concern so but that&amp;#39;s kind of we&amp;#39;ve gone we&amp;#39;ve gone deep pretty quick I want to preface by taking a step back and saying the natural electromagnetic spectrum what is that right we covered the solar Spectrum so that&amp;#39;s a big piece UV to infrared that is the sun that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been exposed to the Earth has a natural magnetic field electric field and that is oscillating in the very low frequency range so there&amp;#39;s a few components to that but the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic field vitally important because if it wasn&amp;#39;t for the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic field which is a result of the molten iron core um which is moving charges and moving charges generates a magnetic field uh that actually protects our Earth our planet from the very harmful ionizing radiation that&amp;#39;s coming from the Sun and doesn&amp;#39;t make it to the surface uh of the Earth because we have this magnetic field protecting us so and we have this magnetosphere and it&amp;#39;s cool because when it&amp;#39;s facing the sun it&amp;#39;s you know extended in in One Direction so when we rotate we&amp;#39;re actually getting we&amp;#39;re in a changing magnetic field constantly and a changing magnetic field through law of induction results in an electric field being induced on the planet and we have you know an electric field as well because of that and that&amp;#39;s natural but they&amp;#39;re very low intensity so the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic field is like a 40 to 60 micro Tesla which probably means nothing to anybody listening to this but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very low intensity it&amp;#39;s a weak magnetic field but it&amp;#39;s very important for biological functions and it&amp;#39;s something that we have taken as an input signal for a very long time and it&amp;#39;s different at different locations because the the Earth is almost like a a giant bar magnet and the you know you&amp;#39;ve heard of the the North Pole and there&amp;#39;s like a magnetic north and there&amp;#39;s a magnetic South as well very close to the",

that I built Guys these are the highest quality ingredients on the planet if you&amp;#39;re not aware of lineage Provisions you&amp;#39;re missing out our newest product one of our newest products is air dried steak it&amp;#39;s grass-fed beef organic vinegar and sea salt that&amp;#39;s it it&amp;#39;s like the best jerky you&amp;#39;ll ever have in your life we make meat sticks we have a grassfed protein powder we have creatine glyphosate free honey check us out at lineage provisions.com our mission is to really fight against big food and make convenience Foods much more healthy than they are today so check us out lineat provisions.com back to the podcast it&amp;#39;s wild I think that was a lot for people to digest I&amp;#39;ll try and just summarize it basically there&amp;#39;s this environment on the earth of these very low frequency electromagnetic environments these electromagnetic waves with the like you know you said 60 HZ 100 Hertz even lower up to maybe slightly more than that what we&amp;#39;ve created in 2025 is a very non-native EMF environment our cell phone you said is 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is yep what about the cellular signal depends where you are and what you know Network you&amp;#39;re on but it can range from like 800 mahz to I mean technically if you&amp;#39;re on a millimeter wave up to 30 gahz and that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s oscillating yeah yeah and these are all non-native emfs when I turn the Wi-Fi router on at my house it&amp;#39;s that 2.4 gigahertz band what&amp;#39;s interesting for me just to kind of make it sort of grounded for people a little bit is the idea that a microwave is about 2.4 GHz right 2.45 yeah 4 GHz so your cell phone Wi-Fi your Wi-Fi in your house is basically putting out the same radio frequency EMF that your microwave is putting out correct so the microwave has shielding and I&amp;#39;ve measured this and I did a re about this where I measured with an RF meter 3 feet from the microwave and it was around what you&amp;#39;d get putting airpods in your ears so you can imagine if you&amp;#39;re wearing airpods and again we&amp;#39;ll talk about these in a moment more if you&amp;#39;re wearing Bluetooth devices they&amp;#39;re also in this 2.4 GHz exactly y you&amp;#39;re basically wearing in a small microwave on your head not at the same distance you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re wearing a small microwave like 3 feet from your body or four feet from your body all day and the microwave is going all day and I I just want that to be visceral for people because you think intuitively it&amp;#39;s probably not a good thing for my cellular biology and yet that reel gets fact checked on Instagram and they say the FCC says these are safe there&amp;#39;s no evidence of this Elon Musk who I appreciate for everything he&amp;#39;s doing in the world goes on Rogan and says you could make a helmet this is I&amp;#39;m basically quoting him verbatim you could make a helmet of cell phones and it would not be harmful for humans it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s wild to think just because they&amp;#39;re nonionizing or because the sun ultraviolet has more energy or more power that we shouldn&amp;#39;t think about the EMF coming off our phones it&amp;#39;s clearly a problem for some people more than others we don&amp;#39;t fully understand it we need to keep asking these questions and this is what the hardest thing for me is is that asking questions became an athema thankfully it&amp;#39;s becoming a little more in style now but um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s wild to think that you just get labeled tinf foil hat wearer you know climate denier whatever you know denier this black ball name this you know pejorative term this when you&amp;#39;re asking questions about EMF and how it&amp;#39;s affecting us it&amp;#39;s incredible so okay so here we sit let&amp;#39;s get a background reading in the room again like you said at my house in Costa Rica it&amp;#39;s essentially zero microwatts per meter squared and that&amp;#39;s a measure of power density so that is standard for for radio frequencies um to measure with that with that unit so with this guy which is the same one I have the safe and sound pro two we&amp;#39;re seeing a peak 2 to 5,000 microwatts per meter squared how do you read this with the meter if people want to see this that&amp;#39;s what it looks like right now so when you&amp;#39;re looking at this what do you look at Tristan it says the max was 13,000 microwatts per meter squared yeah I I try and think of it like the fact that well they give you these like their their range so we&amp;#39;re in the quote unquote extreme range is very strict by the way and it&amp;#39;s based on I believe like the building biology institutes um guidelines but it&amp;#39;s also based on where there&amp;#39;s research for this you know level of power density and I just pulled up a PDF and they have research showing harmful effects as as low like far below this basically you have to be in the green or moderate range here which is like we&amp;#39;re talking 500 microwatts per met squared or less and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really low that&amp;#39;s like really hard to get that low I mean you&amp;#39;re in Costa Rica City yeah where I&amp;#39;m at my house in Wyoming and I&amp;#39;m fully hardwired I&amp;#39;m at like 100 to 200 and I&amp;#39;m like really happy with it there hard wire in your house hard wi there&amp;#39;s ethernet going to your computer which is what I do in Costa Rica Y and there&amp;#39;s nothing on um the moment you turn like let&amp;#39;s just do like I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll turn my phone on on Wi-Fi here and and cellular oh there&amp;#39;s not even Wi-Fi no but it&amp;#39;s connect I turned the Wi-Fi on and now it just connected to the network and it&amp;#39;s spiked up to around 100,000 microwatts per meter squared and that&amp;#39;s what people need to know radio frequencies they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re highly pulsed in nature and that&amp;#39;s another problem and actually people you know I mentioned Robert Ocker already he argued that the reason why radio frequencies are bad is because they&amp;#39;re actually pulsing at this low frequency range where again we&amp;#39;re mentioning biology is operating so how how do people think about this well your Alpha Brain Wave is you know 7 to 10 Hertz and I mentioned the schumans resonance is in that 7 to 10 Hertz range so and there&amp;#39;s higher levels of frequency for other brain waves and then we&amp;#39;re getting all of a sudden pretty close to electrical power which is at 50 HZ internationally and 60 htz here in the US so in engineering we have terms for these things it&amp;#39;s called electromagnetic interference and when you&amp;#39;re designing you know Electronics or anything you need to consider that there might be some interference and if you have you know the same frequency or the same frequency band you can have levels of interference so the way I like to think about this for everyone is really simple is like emfs are noise in our environment you and I we&amp;#39;re in a room sitting across from each other can hear you very clearly it&amp;#39;s great conversation there&amp;#39;s no issue the signal is very strong now imagine if there were a hundred people or even 20 people in this room and we were all talking it would be really hard to understand what you&amp;#39;re saying and like we might miscommunicate we might you know perceive each other in in the wrong manner that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening in our biology our biology is designed to take these electromagnetic input signals to drive function whether it&amp;#39;s light whether it&amp;#39;s you know the magnetic field of the earth these have all been shown to be very important especially for things like circadian rhythm and hormone function and sleep Etc now all of a sudden we have all this other stuff like the magnetic spec electromagnetic spectrum is just like filled up with all this stuff and this is just measuring 200 megz to 8 GHz there&amp;#39;s DC Static magnetic fields there&amp;#39;s power supplies switching at different frequencies this is not even measuring this is like a snippet of just the radio frequency and Wi-Fi chip that are in this device there&amp;#39;s so much more so now all of a sudden we have all this noise on the line that signal to noise ratio which is what we call it in engineering is low and what happens when that&amp;#39;s slow well you&amp;#39;re going to have issues you&amp;#39;re going to have communication issues and you&amp;#39;re going to have biological chaos really and that&amp;#39;s another word for for inflammation or oxidative stress and you look at you know something like the mitochondria and it makes a lot of sense because that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s designed to do it&amp;#39;s designed to kind of be an electromagnetic sensor of our environment and that&amp;#39;s what all these studies show and people think it&amp;#39;s you know nonsense because they show Ridiculous things they show that you know it&amp;#39;s you know sperm quality is like in the toilet because of RF emfs and that&amp;#39;s something even huberman has talked about and that&amp;#39;s almost like fertility clinics tell you to not hold your phone in your pocket and why well you know this is a very electromagnetically sensitive area of our body and you know mitochondria extremely important for for Reproductive health so it it it shouldn&amp;#39;t be treated as woo woo if you just think about it from you know a a logical perspective and yeah we don&amp;#39;t know and sometimes times these you know studies there&amp;#39;s studies showing beneficial effects but the things that are key is the duration of exposure so the key for me and you know we can get into what you can do about it is whenever you reach this chronic level of exposure 24 hours 48 72 hours that&amp;#39;s when you see all these detrimental effects taking place you could have potentially a beneficial effect at a certain you know frequency uh you know for an hour or two hours like we don&amp;#39;t really know and there&amp;#39;s so much complexity and this is where I think you know this is really challenging to talk about because anyone who like took physics 101 or 2011 knows the direction of the field matters the intensity the distance how Fields interact with each other uh it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s really complicated but we could say I can say confidently based on the body of evidence we&amp;#39;ve had have based on the fact this has been a debate for decades um we should really be cautious here and we should look into this because why should we risk our health as a society for technology when there potentially could be better Solutions if we just acknowledge that this may be a problem and you know that&amp;#39;s also what I want to do at daylight is is try and reinvent Wireless technology start asking these questions because again we&amp;#39;re giving our children these devices younger and younger and who is most sensitive to electromagnetic inputs children it behaviors let&amp;#39;s see what this is when I put mine on like a cellular signal because that&amp;#39;ll bump up even higher yeah 3 million 3 million microwatts per meter Square it&amp;#39;s peeking at 3 million on my cellular that&amp;#39;s cuz you just turned it on and it&amp;#39;s searching for the signal so the the RF EMF output&amp;#39;s going to be the highest when it&amp;#39;s searching for a signal so you know people who put their phone in airplane mode if you&amp;#39;re like you know on on our side and believe what we&amp;#39;re saying and that&amp;#39;s what I do then you need to be careful when you take it off airplane mode for like 5 to 10 seconds because that&amp;#39;s when it&amp;#39;s going to be outputting the highest power density wave so that it can connect to the signal massive and same thing in low like low signal areas like if you&amp;#39;re driving the middle of nowhere and things it&amp;#39;s going to bump up power like 3 to 4X to try and get that signal out and the other thing we talked about before is most people don&amp;#39;t realize that when you have cellular data and Wi-Fi on at the same time you using that&amp;#39;s like double the exposure because you&amp;#39;re using us two different mechanisms to probably do the same thing so I would recommend you&amp;#39;re probably not going to hardwire your internet but if you can just like stay on Wi-Fi which is typically lower power density then keep your phone on airplane mode with just Wi-Fi on you&amp;#39;re saving yourself the cellular data connection exposure and it&amp;#39;s just unnecessary so I want people to understand that the single greatest source of exposure to rfmf is your cell phone more than your Wi-Fi router this thing is on your body all the time I mean that spikes to 3 million microwatts per meter squar for 5 to 10 seconds when I turned it on if this thing is on my body doing that like your cell phone on your body that is the single biggest exposure you have to RF so here&amp;#39;s how you make the action right here&amp;#39;s how we change behaviors know what&amp;#39;s going on with your cell phone keep your cell phone on airplane mode as much as you possibly can and in order to be on",

and in order to be on airplane mode fully I want to show people this the airplane icon needs to be on and the Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth icons need to be that that like sort of dark strike through the strike through gray sometimes you will turn the Wi-Fi on and you&amp;#39;ll and then you&amp;#39;ll turn it back off and it turns white right the Wi-Fi is not off on your phone if it&amp;#39;s white let me get it to do that same with Bluetooth same with Bluetooth on your phone so you can see here on my phone now the Wi-Fi icon is white it&amp;#39;s not off it&amp;#39;s still putting out a Wi-Fi signal the same with Bluetooth and now I&amp;#39;ve gone to airplane mode and it&amp;#39;s still white so this is still putting out rfmf from the Wi-Fi antenna on my phone I actually now have to go into settings send this to your friends guys who don&amp;#39;t know this I have to go into settings and turn off the Wi-Fi there to get it to go fully off and now on my phone the Wi-Fi is fully gray that&amp;#39;s a big deal your phone is the single biggest exposure you have so whenever I&amp;#39;m walking around with my phone it&amp;#39;s on full airplane mode like this if I&amp;#39;m out doing things in the world and I want to check my messages I&amp;#39;ll take it off and I&amp;#39;ll use it and then I&amp;#39;ll turn it off I don&amp;#39;t want to be paying attention to my phone all the time I don&amp;#39;t need to get every single notification in the moment it comes in unless I&amp;#39;m in a very you know a very time critical communication with someone on my team or someone that I want to talk to so that&amp;#39;s a hard thing but your phones the phones your kids have and similarly probably any iPads that have Cellular Connections these are big big problems for RF the Wi-Fi rou router in your house less so but still a still a problem don&amp;#39;t sleep next to your Wi-Fi router if you put this next to year WI router you&amp;#39;d get some of the same readings so basically your cell phone is like having a Wi-Fi router next to you all the time and remember it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s your airpods and your ear are kind of like having a Wi-Fi router in your ear all day and they&amp;#39;re transmitting a signal through your brain with oxidative stress DNA damage and so look I get it guys you want to go to the gym you don&amp;#39;t want a cord but does it cause headaches for you we don&amp;#39;t really know what these things do long term and hopefully we&amp;#39;ll get some actual honest research about this because there&amp;#39;s thousands of studies you&amp;#39;re talking about they&amp;#39;re just being suppressed by the FCC and these these tech companies they don&amp;#39;t want us to know can you imagine how bad this would be for the tech companies if we really started to think about how problematic these things are for humans or at least ask the honest questions we should not be you know slinging pejorative epithets of people um saying you&amp;#39;re a tinfoil hat wearing person and that&amp;#39;s all that that&amp;#39;s what I get and I don&amp;#39;t care I&amp;#39;m still going to talk about it one of the things I brought at the house it&amp;#39;s pretty funny I&amp;#39;ve been traveling with this just an experiment is a is a Wi-Fi is a faraday tent so I&amp;#39;m sleeping in uh like a zero or very very low EMF environment tent that I can travel with in Costa Rica I don&amp;#39;t have to do this because there&amp;#39;s no Wi-Fi at my house there&amp;#39;s no cell signal people come to my house and they say what&amp;#39;s the Wi-Fi and I say there&amp;#39;s a cord right there you can plug it in and just so people understand this there are ethernet to lightning or ethernet to USB adapters on Amazon you can plug your phone into ethernet I can use my iPhone I have an iPhone 13 because I&amp;#39;m not super tech you know can plug my lightning adapter into my I can use my phone with zero RF coming off it to an ethernet cable it&amp;#39;s less convenient I&amp;#39;m willing to make that decision in my life and I will say even you know it&amp;#39;s really actually hard to turn the Wi-Fi off in like with a router you have to know how to do it you have to know how or you have to Shield it that&amp;#39;s what I do at my house because you can&amp;#39;t even like used to be able to type in the IP address and like log into it and disable the antennas you can&amp;#39;t even do that anymore but what you&amp;#39;re saying is important because what I realized is that the devices themselves are are more important because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s closest to you now again we&amp;#39;re talking electromagnetic waves Decay at a you know r squared Factor so the distance distance is your best friend and if you like let&amp;#39;s say at home what I did for a while is yeah I have my Wi-Fi router and I have a shield to actually put like a faraday beanie over you could put tin foil over it and actually reduce it like 80% that&amp;#39;s crazy and faay bags on Amazon too they&amp;#39;re 20 bucks you can buy a faay bag for 20 bucks so you can do that and the connection&amp;#39;s still fine as long as you&amp;#39;re not going like you know to your next neighbor&amp;#39;s house like it&amp;#39;s more than strong enough and then you can run an ethernet cord to where you still technically have the Wi-Fi somewhat on but it&amp;#39;s shielded and then connect that to your phone or connect that to your laptop and then you turn your laptop or phone on airplane mode so you&amp;#39;re not transmitting or receiving the RF signal but you still get internet and it&amp;#39;s actually faster if you connect to ethernet it&amp;#39;s more secure like hardwiring is fantastic I just don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;re going to you know accomplish anything a large scale but that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m really excited to think about you know like for daylight what we&amp;#39;re rolling out later this year is we&amp;#39;re going to call it smart airplane mode so right now I&amp;#39;ve been just sitting with this next to me in the podcast the whole time I&amp;#39;ve used the internet like twice in about you know an hour and a half two hours it could have just been on airplane mode the entire time and we&amp;#39;re going to make sure that that&amp;#39;s an automated thing by default so instead of you having to manually go into settings and all that oh it&amp;#39;s just in airplane mode if you it&amp;#39;s on standby or you&amp;#39;re taking notes or you&amp;#39;re reading and I think that&amp;#39;s a pretty big deal why is my iPhone not like that I guess because people want to get messages yeah yeah because they want you to be notified they want you to be on screen they want you to be in that world PL me in as long as you can and then the next step is what I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about how do we actually go at the hardware level and try and figure this out how do we get intelligent maybe we when I&amp;#39;m holding my daily computer or whatever future device only it&amp;#39;s only radiating like out away",

hotel where I can&amp;#39;t control the Wi-Fi around me in an Airbnb I can turn the Wi-Fi Rider off at night I put my phone on airplane node every every single night my phone is on airplane mode why is your phone not on airplane mode guys it&amp;#39;s crazy and you mentioned this earlier how important sleep is and we&amp;#39;ve talked about melatonin in depth but I want to kind of get back to this because during the day you know you&amp;#39;re going to have limited control over what you can do if you use your phone differently I think that&amp;#39;s huge if you can you know just think about distance between you and technology and that&amp;#39;s where um you know wired headphone speaker phone things are like really important but your sleep environment it&amp;#39;s the most important thing it&amp;#39;s the most important because um that is when you&amp;#39;re going through all the cellular repair the autophagy the apoptosis and if you if you&amp;#39;re getting assaulted by this stuff when you&amp;#39;re sleeping and you know the studies showing that EMF exposure and of course the blue light at night like we discussed that&amp;#39;s going to disrupt your Sleep Quality so you&amp;#39;re getting this Onslaught during the day you&amp;#39;re losing the battle during the day give yourself a Fighting Chance at nighttime and that&amp;#39;s where if you can&amp;#39;t make a significant impact you work a 9 to-5 dial in your sleep exposure turn the Wi-Fi off there&amp;#39;s no reason why you need it on at nighttime um get your phone out of the bedroom turn it on airplane mode and you know appreciate use the bedroom for for sleeping and if you want to go to a next level you can switch the breaker off to your house that&amp;#39;s you or to your bedroom specifically that&amp;#39;s what I do because I think electrical power is also a huge concern and we can talk about about that but really dialing in your sleep environment is just going to give you the best chance and really set you up for Success long term else you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re losing that battle every single day to a higher degree you have to optimize your sleep environment so you know I think Brian Johnson does this well in some ways going back to him um he makes it very dark but he&amp;#39;s not thinking about Wi-Fi he&amp;#39;s not thinking he&amp;#39;s never talked about EMF he&amp;#39;s never talked about any of these things he&amp;#39;s not talking about elf and his you know environment in his house he lives in Venice he&amp;#39;s talked about this and I bet if you went to his house and you turn on this meter there would be thousands hundreds or thousands uh hundreds or thousands of microwatts per meter Square in his bedroom he&amp;#39;s leaving money on the table there absolutely in terms of longevity I want to ask you about airport scanners it&amp;#39;s millimeter wave is what they say and the TSA folks are like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s no big deal and I think I need to ask Tristan about this because you&amp;#39;re letting a a child all the children go through the metal detectors but what kind of an Expos am I getting in the airport scanners one phone call is probably like 10,000 times stronger than that one phone call probably yeah I I I forget the exact numbers I did I made an EMF course last year and it has all the specifics there&amp;#39;s so many different things you know airport scanners they are millimeter wave but the duration and the intensity it&amp;#39;s your phone is a million times more important so it&amp;#39;s not even a big deal I again I have pre-check I go through metal detector but you know what&amp;#39;s more important the fact that you&amp;#39;re near a thousand people people that all are on 5G there&amp;#39;s millimeter waves in an airport for 5G and you&amp;#39;re getting assaulted then you&amp;#39;re getting on an airplane uh which now has Wi-Fi it&amp;#39;s a different frequency because it&amp;#39;s satellite based Wi-Fi and then you&amp;#39;re in like a metal tube and there&amp;#39;s TVs on the back of your head that also have you know power running to it and then you&amp;#39;re sitting on a window which is next to a rotating High powerered motor which is generating a very strong magnetic field so I think the airport scanner is the Dr a buck 15 item on the list of things to be worried about and circadian disruption if it&amp;#39;s like a long haul flight and everything else I just mentioned is is way more I appreciate that perspective I appreciate that perspective you know there&amp;#39;s other things dude like um uh speed like speed radar guns traffic scanners that&amp;#39;s something that you know cruise control like these are all using radio frequencies and actually there is a study that in the 90s they correlated like cops that used um they used millimeter WS used like 33 GHz for for Speed speed guns and cops were just like you know they leave them on their lap and they found that cops had like a multiple fold higher increase risk of tesc cancer yeah there&amp;#39;s so many like random things like that and you live in like cities and you know when people lock on their cruise control you&amp;#39;re getting a speed gun again it&amp;#39;s not the duration is not super intense but it&amp;#39;s just crazy how widely used the electromagnetic spectrum is and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not just technology in terms of wireless devices it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot so policeman out there take the speed guns off your lap take anything off your lap take your laptop off your lap like put distance from you and if you just move it from like you have it on a desk if you had that on your lap that&amp;#39;s probably like thousand 10,000 fold reduction in the field so you&amp;#39;re going from R squ right yeah yeah so like yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just the biggest lever that you can pull and then the duration piece as as well I think shielding is a bit complicated I will say that I I&amp;#39;m excited to test your tent but I think you have to be careful with with some forms of shielding um like painting your bedroom yeah I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s a great idea because it&amp;#39;s reflecting yeah it&amp;#39;s reflecting and then yeah it depends on the environment you&amp;#39;re in what I like to tell people whether it&amp;#39;s for grounding or anything or shielding like try and reduce the exposure the sources as best you can is your first step and then think about you never want to block like the Earth&amp;#39;s natural emfs either which low frequency they&amp;#39;re magnetic field so if you&amp;#39;re optimizing for radio frequency You&amp;#39; probably be fine but that&amp;#39;s where you know the electrical power piece is is is pretty important yeah yeah okay so we talked about airpods I think they&amp;#39;re horrible wired headphones I can I make a case for airpods okay if if you were taking a phone call all right and you were using airpods instead of holding your phone next to your brain way better okay so I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll make the case for airpods that uh if the phone is even further away from you I think that would be a net positive because the phone is like such a higher output power density the worst thing you could do is hold your phone the worst thing you can and they tell you manufacturing warning label never hold it against your body never hold it against your head and if you get a Glo blastoma you&amp;#39;re never going to be able to sue them because of that which is a very very aggressive cancer yes so I would say yes if you have a 2.4 GHz Bluetooth signal and you&amp;#39;re a finance bro and you got them in all day and you&amp;#39;re taking all the calls of course that&amp;#39;s not ideal um but most people who do that they also have their phone in their pocket or on their body um so that&amp;#39;s like a a negative you know times two where if you use the Bluetooth or use any headphones to try and get the phone away from you as far as possible you could argue that that might be a net positive okay let&amp;#39;s make the case for Wired headphones versus airpods significant reduction an EMF no Bluetooth no Bluetooth so what I&amp;#39;ll do if I&amp;#39;m going to use wired headphones and again this is a in my ass but I&amp;#39;ll do it if I&amp;#39;m walking and I want want to listen",

I&amp;#39;m walking and I want want to listen want to listen to a podcast I&amp;#39;ll download it onto my phone put it on completely airplane mode and walk with wired headphones and you can use something like air tubes which have as tues even better even better air tubes inferior audio experience horrible audio experience better from an RF perspective but look like I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not trying to be an audio file when I&amp;#39;m walking in the morning or I&amp;#39;m walking Somewhere listening to a podcast right or any of these experiences so that&amp;#39;s way better and I think you you know you can use a wired headphone I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys knew this you can use wired headphones on your computer and you can you can watch a movie on your computer with wired headphones versus airpods you can use wired headphones on an airplane guys I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys knew this they give to you they give them to you those are the worst I&amp;#39;ve ever had in my whole life but I can bring my air tube headphones right onto an airplane because it has the ox cable and I can watch a movie with these versus my airpods you don&amp;#39;t have to use airpods on a flight yeah it&amp;#39;s more convenient I get it what are we trading for it we don&amp;#39;t fully no yeah um let&amp;#39;s talk about Teslas for a minute let&amp;#39;s talk about electric cars what do you think well let&amp;#39;s preface by saying the semiconductor Electronics content of an EV is I mean it might be like 500 times higher than like your standard internal combustion engine vehicle from like 5 years earlier every single car is going through a transformation of far more electronic components even my 4Runner which is 2 years old like has all these sensors and it drives me insane but but um it&amp;#39;s hard to gauge the RF like component of it but for sure you have all these screens you have way more think more the magnetics so what I was going to get to is I think the biggest detriment of cars both IC and electric vehicles is the magnetic field component and a big problem in general in terms of like dirty EMF or like high EMF things is when you&amp;#39;re converting power whether it&amp;#39;s DC to DC AC to DC or DC to AC um because you&amp;#39;re using a lot of rectification and it&amp;#39;s resulting in a lot of emfs so electric vehicle has these you know 400 800 volt batteries they&amp;#39;re DC and then they have to convert that at very high power to run their AC induction motor and I used to work for a company that sold these chips that you know were really high power traction inverters like transistors that basically do that conversion and that results in a ton of emfs ton of like very high magnetic field exposure and magnetic fields is concerning and I want to I want to raise this point we don&amp;#39;t need to go too deep in the studies but there has been over you know multiple um agreed upon research population level studies showing that very weak magnetic fields increase statistically significant increased risk in childhood leukemia and that is why the IC which is imperfect in many ways you know red meat is on the list but right I want people to know that magnetic fields and radio frequencies are both both on the list of possible carcinogens from the IC and magnetic fields was on there earlier because of this research they came out for for weak magnetic fields um and you know it all started with with power lines and it&amp;#39;s just crazy vage power lines it goes back to like the 60s to where people you know started studying this stuff and then uh they started figuring out there was there was negative effects of magnetic fields and from power lines and this was the old the bigger em F discussion and it was actually you know a big deal in the 60s 7s 80s up until like the late 90s and I just it&amp;#39;s crazy because what happened I just go on a little story I wrote it down here the Navy tried to build this antenna for submarine Communication in Wisconsin called uh it was called like project sanguin and because extremely low frequencies can penetrate water and go uh you know underwater to communicate to submarines so they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to come to the surface they used to always have to come to service to get like signals so this is like a breakthrough thing and they asked Robert o Becker amongst other you know well-known scientists and researchers and practitioners to review the research on these type of EF waves now the antenna was like 45 and 70 Hertz most the research and you know well-known um kind of results were at 60 HZ and they said a generic statement and said like although this antenna is like 1 million times lower intensity than power lines uh there is significant research showing biological effect negative biological effects of power lines and we recommend that you know you don&amp;#39;t build this the Navy suppressed the studies and then you know Robert Ocker got pissed then he went and told this like power lines commission about the same things and he started doing his own studies and he found like in three generations of rats 60 htz exposure magnetic fields was you know infant mortality rates were were through the roof and then you know there was this whole controversy people started protesting this antenna being built it moved to Michigan it changed names like three times I think eventually like 15 years later but that he got cancelled because of that he was like one of the first doctors to get to get cancelled because he spoke out about it and at the same time this New York like power line commission utility they were spending millions of dollars trying to disprove like this research and at the same time another researcher came out epidemiological data saying only three or four migal magnetic field exposure which is nothing is increased statistical significant risk of childhood leukemia and the the utility company funded all the study to disprove it wow in Denver they did it I think she did it in North Carolina was her pool uh of population and they spent all this money and then they came out with the same results they actually it was like a bombshell they show that and but then you know what the utility company said they said the public has accepted the safety risk we&amp;#39;re setting the safety Thresh standard to 100 milligals and that&amp;#39;s it sorry we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re not going to do much about it and you know there&amp;#39;s more researchers in the 90s that showed you know breast cancer proliferation for 60 HZ Fields blocks melatonin and you know the anti-cancer properties and then that guy got slammed for like making up data in the in the late 90s and a lot of controversy I mean Robert OB Becker went on 60 Minutes this is like you can look this up and it&amp;#39;s funny they&amp;#39;re like do you think there&amp;#39;s biological effects of like low frequency Fields he&amp;#39;s just like yes like it affects like you know stress markers and triglyceride levels was like the thing there and you know multi-decade debate and what happened no one has ever heard of that and nothing has changed nothing has changed and it&amp;#39;s really sad because I power lines and electrical power again it&amp;#39;s not this complicated problem if you use shielded cabling and like conduit and things you could reduce your exposure 95% in your house or you can just get a little relay installed and switch all the breakers off at night time except for what you absolutely need on or you know maybe we don&amp;#39;t have high voltage transmission lines near schools or near hospitals and countries in Eastern Europe again this was a big item during the Cold War was emfs crazy because the Soviet Union was big and still is very stringent worried on EMF standards and in those countries like Eastern Europe and Russia they have like 10 100,000x stricter safety thresholds and then they have even more specific more strict thresholds for public places schools and hospitals wow and wow [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s frustrating when you read all of this history and you know going back I mean talking back to like radio frequencies in in 1928 the first GE plant that was testing like radio transmitters it was only 27 mahz they had all these like workers who getting sick and super chronic fatigue a doctor came in and was like you guys should probably not do this like these fields could be dangerous but then they&amp;#39;ve realized like at that time like fever was like a good thing from a medical practice perspective because that was like the body&amp;#39;s natural response radio frequencies became a medical treatment he gave people fever and then World War II happened and that exploded you know radio communication the military started doing all these studies but then it was so useful for them they suppressed everything so here we are lot of so much research but it&amp;#39;s all like classified Declassified and controversial nobody talks about it it&amp;#39;s tin hoil tinfoil hat it&amp;#39;s like dude the Navy funded this study what do you mean like they they funded one study where you know he talked about how certain Fields can have resonant effect on certain minerals and the Navy funded one study that said a 60 HZ field in a certain location where the Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic field um was like uh like 30 or 40 microtesla actually the resonance matches up to increase the I guess the activity of lithium in the body and found that these rats and mice became like more docile and like passive and the calcium is a big one for EMS affecting how calcium works and E flux into the cell voltage gated ion channels are but it&amp;#39;s not ionizing Tristan it&amp;#39;s not ionizing so it doesn&amp;#39;t affect humans right there&amp;#39;s just so much there and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s crazy because there&amp;#39;s decades and Decades of research and no nobody&amp;#39;s aware of it it&amp;#39;s really inconvenient and yeah I get it the infrastructure is the infrastructure of our grid and how Tech is set up but we could make some really simple fixes and it could have a big lever know better do better you&amp;#39;ll make different decisions in your life so so there&amp;#39;s a couple things I want people to understand about how they use these things we talked about cell phones putting it on airplane mode not having it with you this last conversation has been about the the EF and the magnetic fields and so you can get a trifield meter and measure the magnetic field I okay great so this guy the safe and sound is only RF EMF so we can measure the magnetic field in this room and I&amp;#39;ve used this to measure the magnetic field in a Tesla and I&amp;#39;ll tell tell people about the results of that once we get the magnetic field it&amp;#39;s pretty low in here yeah point like0 five but if I went next to this electrical outlet say that again it&amp;#39;s 0 five milligals milligals okay so now he&amp;#39;s going to go next to an outlet with this yeah it&amp;#39;s like four four to five mil it&amp;#39;s like four to five migal next to yeah which is kind of interesting because how many of us sleep in beds with heads with heads that are right next to an outlet and so you have a pretty big magnetic field right there yeah how and remember the threshold for childhood leukemia is only 3 to four milligals for increased statistically significant risk wow okay so what we should be doing is I should be if I have a bed and my bed is NE this is crazy guys I mean this is not tinf foil hatch [ __ ] we&amp;#39;re actually using a meter if I have a a bed I should be using I should be putting the headboard of the bed away from the outlet into the middle of the room because this is r squared and right here where we&amp;#39;re sitting which is about you know four and a half feet from the wall it&amp;#39;s 0.5 but if your head is right there you&amp;#39;re sleeping in four to five migal all night yeah what the heck yeah ideally yeah you sleep in the center of the room because you&amp;#39;re also getting you know electric field exposure from from the the voltage in the wires as well the wall yeah and that you can measure uh with a with a multimeter body voltage is the in my op the best way to measure kind of like EF exposure because electric fields are being uh induced on our body and you can measure it you literally hold a positive lead connect it to ground and in a hot room you&amp;#39;ll have like two volts ac induced on your body it&amp;#39;s through capacitive coupling because our body is like you know semiconductive and you want to get that as low as possible so that&amp;#39;s why I say I turn the power off in my bedroom you can get a product that or you can get your electrician to install something um that is like a relay to where you shut it all off at night or if you&amp;#39;re building a new house put conduit in your bedroom put shielded cabling in your bedroom in your office so that way you have far lower you know EMF exposure and nothing is different nothing is different in Costa Rica I flip the breakers to my house I mean to my room you know the fan still works above me but the outlets near my head are off um and I can measure the I can measure the magnetic field the elf in my room we can measure it we&amp;#39;ll measure it at the Airbnb and and do some content about that after this podcast but yeah I wonder about that because I&amp;#39;m always sleeping with my head right next to the wall and I know all of you guys are sleeping with your beds and they make they design bedrooms to have outlets right next to the bed so that you can plug your cell phone in right next to the bed and you can charge your cell phone right next to your head while you&amp;#39;re sleeping and it&amp;#39;s not on airplane mode so think about this absolute train wreck of an electromagnetic environment that most of us are sleeping in and we&amp;#39;ve in this podcast we&amp;#39;ve given you easy actionable steps to fix all of those things or at least mitigate them significantly um yeah I think a magnetic field is really valuable I&amp;#39;ll tell you about the Tesla so what was interesting for me is that the Tesla actually didn&amp;#39;t have that much more magnetic field than a gas powered car because I think they&amp;#39;ve shielded it really well at certain levels so if you put the magnetic field if you put the trifield meter at your feet you get a bigger reading and then driver&amp;#39;s passenger side driver versus I&amp;#39;m on the I&amp;#39;m on the passenger side we should have measured it on the driver&amp;#39;s side but this is one of the reasons I don&amp;#39;t like Teslas because I&amp;#39;m sure the magnetic field is higher than your combustible I will say a big V6 V8 uh IC is not good either like my 4Runner when I&amp;#39;m driving in my driver seat is like four milligals too really yeah it&amp;#39;s not great I think EVS are worse because again these are only measuring some things like there is so much going on there is so many like there&amp;#39;s DC fields that also have an impact and that&amp;#39;s like duding what&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re getting from the natural magnetic field there&amp;#39;s power supply that are switching from 200 khz to 2 mahz there&amp;#39;s microcontrollers that are micro you know processing units that are typically switching around 100 megahertz now these are smaller but um there&amp;#39;s a lot there&amp;#39;s a lot those traction inverters they&amp;#39;re not switching in like a measurable radio frequency range either but but they&amp;#39;re switching so the EVS are definitely worse I think the magnetic field is a concern for me for all cars if you if you want to have the lowest EMF car buy like a 2005 Toyota Camry and like that but but guess what if we just recognize that we could probably shield and or it doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be anything crazy just reflect it back forward and you know then it&amp;#39;s not coming through to the passenger and the driver it it would be really not that hard to do that you can make changes in the actual technology without a doubt yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty significant in cars and it&amp;#39;s more a thing for people that are driving all the time or spending a bunch of time in your car I don&amp;#39;t spend much time in my car but yeah I have a truck it&amp;#39;s internal combustion engine but I yeah the Teslas aren&amp;#39;t as bad as I thought incidentally when I was testing the Tesla I walked under a high voltage power line with my trifield meter and the magnetic field went to 19 19 milligals under under a power line in Dripping Springs Texas this is what Harden soil headquarters there so that&amp;#39;s crazy right that&amp;#39;s just crazy to think about um what&amp;#39;s around your house are you next to high voltage power lines there was a gym that I worked out out in in Los Angeles and there was a high voltage power line they had an outdoor space at the the gym which I liked I was hitting the punching bags at the outdoor space and there&amp;#39;s a high voltage power line running right there and I look down the alley and there&amp;#39;s an apartment building and the high voltage power line goes literally a few feet from the high from the apartment I think whoever lives in that apartment like if they bedroom like they don&amp;#39;t even we&amp;#39;re not even thinking about this but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a safety hazard for that human and yet it&amp;#39;s being allowed to happen presumably that that conduit there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s no shielding in that cable no no living near high voltage transmission lines substation airports like you know RF Towers that&amp;#39;s really bad like hor cuz that distance again I&amp;#39;m talking like very close like if you&amp;#39;re half a mile away it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not so bad but if if you&amp;#39;re like a block away from any of those things highly recommend moving highly recommend and I have a lot of friends that are EMF consultants and they say like you know they get some scary stories where like yeah there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a tower on top of the building or they live right next to high voltage transmission line they&amp;#39;re kid has cancer you know and it&amp;#39;s it you know anecdotal experience but based on the research that&amp;#39;s been available for decades now it&amp;#39;s not unsubstantiated I stayed at a hotel in Miami I always stay at airbnbs but I stayed at this hotel for a night and I look right across the parking lot and there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a cellular antenna repeater on the apartment complex roof and these people are literally living beneath a cell antenna and I don&amp;#39;t think they have any idea they&amp;#39;re like great but I would still say the phone more important more important Y and cuz even the car guess what&amp;#39;s the highest EMF Source in your car your phone your phone yeah phone so that 100% that&amp;#39;s a good takeaway I mean the magnetic field is still relevant but guess what you can do about your you know alternator in your car pretty much nothing so it&amp;#39;s hard you get really excited when you find out all this information but then focus on what you can control and I would say if you&amp;#39;re driving for long distances uh and you need to make phone calls or something I I make phone calls when I drive you know it&amp;#39;s productive and passes the time I put my phone like further away I wire it into my car and then it has you know it&amp;#39;s wired connection speaker through carplay and that&amp;#39;s a lot better option or it&amp;#39;s on airplane mode and that&amp;#39;s about the best I can do in terms of you know EMF exposure yeah I make calls in my car also and I have it I have because you can turn the Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth off in your car so I have a 2024 Raptor in Costa Rica and I can turn I turn the Wi-Fi off I turn the Bluetooth off in the car to try and mitigate the RF somewhat I use my phone I will put on airplane mode if I&amp;#39;m doing a phone call I&amp;#39;ll just put it on speaker phone on the dash and I can still hear someone it&amp;#39;s not the best experience but I&amp;#39;m just trying to balance all this I&amp;#39;m not trying to be scared of it I just think that I understand this and I&amp;#39;m trying to mitigate it for the best long-term Health possible because that&amp;#39;s what this is all about like this podcast is not meant to scare you guys it&amp;#39;s meant to give you information because I think so many of these topics are not talked about we never talk about how important it is to know where your cell phone is is it on airplane mode is it actually emitting RF what about the magnetic field what about the EF in your bedroom what about the light that your kids are exposed to what about iPads like this is all information that everyone listening to this podcast can take and do with do with it what you will right make the changes in your life I just want this podcast and everything that I do and I know Tristan feels the same way to add value to your lives and to give you information that you&amp;#39;re not getting elsewhere so yeah and just be like realistic right like I I think what&amp;#39;s important as mentioned is I really want people to take away that our biology is electromagnetic we may you know food&amp;#39;s important water is important we eat let&amp;#39;s say three times a day we drink water I don&amp;#39;t know eight 10 times a day you&amp;#39;re consuming electromagnetic inputs 247 365 days a year that&amp;#39;s just a fact that&amp;#39;s undebatable so we should think about our electromagnetic environment and we should measure it that&amp;#39;s why I like this cuz you know I can go and measure it I can go and I can measure like grounding if it actually is a real thing like I can measure and is a real thing grounding is a real thing we didn&amp;#39;t talk about grounding but it&amp;#39;s a real thing and same thing with the EMF and it&amp;#39;s like oh well that that makes a lot of sense but we&amp;#39;re we need more research and right now you&amp;#39;re only getting research in this space because magnetic fields are pertinent to like space travel and and Magneto reception has been this like fascinating area of biology for a long time for like circumnavigation which is really fascinating um as well to go down this like radical pair mechanism and how that works because you know we just mentioned how does three migal that&amp;#39;s nothing three migal is is a very very weak magnetic field how is that affecting biology so drastically that&amp;#39;s increasing risk of cancer and the the leading kind of guess about that and also how our weak Earth natural magnetic field also affecting biology very much so like they put I think they put some people in like a a full Faraday room with no lights and no like Earth&amp;#39;s natural magnetic field their circadian rhythms became so disrupted like immediately and then it didn&amp;#39;t get fixed until they put both back in the light and the schuman&amp;#39;s resonance like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s deeply we&amp;#39;re deeply tied to the Earth&amp;#39;s natural magnetic envir my is my Faraday tent that I&amp;#39;m sleeping in disrupting the I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s hard to measure is it just silver yeah yeah and we talked about yesterday like silver it should only be reflecting like RF but it&amp;#39;s fully encapsulated so we can try and we can measure it and see what it does for for this but DC magnetic fields I need to I need to buy another meter that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m like I want to test this stuff but is this Schuman resonance getting into my Faraday 10 that&amp;#39;s what I I don&amp;#39;t know for sure like I would say that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m careful with some shielding mechanisms but we&amp;#39;ll have to look it up and it up we&amp;#39;ll have to see if we can measure it but in general it it&amp;#39;s fascinating and we need to understand this stuff because it is fascinating that potentially the whole radical par mechanism hypothesis is that actually we magnetic fields to a certain degree there&amp;#39;s like a goldilock Zone where the weaker the field actually has an increased effect so it&amp;#39;s not a dose dependent response and that&amp;#39;s unfortunate because yeah we have just such a large amount of exposure and it also kind of goes back to what we were saying earlier of how important reactive oxygen species oxidative stress like signaling is that&amp;#39;s happening on a very low intensity level so if this the Earth&amp;#39;s natural magnetic field is is driving radical Pairs and you know reactive oxygen species at a very weak level to execute functions in biology and now we&amp;#39;re completely disrupting that it has like major major consequences but we&amp;#39;re just scratching the surface with with research there and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sensitive the the one kind of group I believe Western Michigan Wendy Bean is studying plaria and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re researching this kind of weak magnetic fields effect on regeneration in plaria and and they found that like at 30 htz is like a peak and then like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s increasing the reactive oxygen species which is increasing the time to repair actually so it&amp;#39;s improving the response to an injury but then if you change the frequency just slightly or if you change the direction of the field it has a different effect so lot of variables here to consider and yeah we need we need far more research but I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really cool it&amp;#39;s really cool and I think just for Simplicity as we wrap this one up because we got to wrap it up this one of the longest ones I&amp;#39;ve ever done um but I knew it was going to go long um the Earth&amp;#39;s frequencies the natural outdoor light this is what we want we want to protect ourselves and potentially minimize the non-native emfs the light the junk light be outside as much as you can be in the Earth&amp;#39;s natural Fields ground as much as you can that&amp;#39;s the answer it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all there for us it&amp;#39;s not complicated and it&amp;#39;s available for us and it&amp;#39;s free everywhere it&amp;#39;s the same as food right if we eat the way our ancestors ate we&amp;#39;re going to do much better um make meat the center of your diet don&amp;#39;t eat seed oils or they&amp;#39;re garbage don&amp;#39;t eat processed foods it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s so intuitive and if we go outside and we interact with our electromagnetic environment in the way that our ancestors did we&amp;#39;ll be so much easier it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s harder with that because of this technological sort of milu that we find ourselves in I think it&amp;#39;s really a return to what&amp;#39;s real you need real food real connection to the local environment and be in the real world which is the natural world that the world we&amp;#39;&amp;#39;re designed to thrive in so the more you can you know tilt your life in that direction to being connected to your local environment and of course your local community and connection extremely important you&amp;#39;re going to be a lot better off and all this stuff we just talked about is fun you know to nerd out on it&amp;#39;s complicated but it can really be that simple is like you get back to a a more natural lifestyle in the best way possible in in a modern environment and I think we&amp;#39;re going to see kind of a a more of an increase in in people pushing for that and I&amp;#39;m really excited I mean 2025 we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the last day here is we have an opportunity here to really change the course of humanity whether it&amp;#39;s from a tech perspective whether it&amp;#39;s from a food perspective everything and I think people are ready for that and I would say you know support and you know share this and educate your loved ones and spend more time outside because that&amp;#39;s what life&amp;#39;s all about more time outside with people care about I think my best memories are in nature with people I care about absolutely where can people find more of your stuff yeah personally at tristore Health on Instagram I&amp;#39;m still at Bitcoin andore beef on Twitter it&amp;#39;s a book I wrote a few years ago um and then yeah the daylight computer we&amp;#39;re at daylight Co and daylight computer.com so check us out you know we just launched in May it&amp;#39;s going super well um and we&amp;#39;re really excited to potentially reinvent you know how we interface with technology with emphasis on on health and productivity I&amp;#39;m excited for the computer and the phone that you guys will make someday and I&amp;#39;ve got the the the tablet and I love it and just people know I have no I have no Financial connections with daylight I just wanted to get all the information out there thanks for being on the show brother thanks Paul",
