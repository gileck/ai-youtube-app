blue light is not bad for us it&amp;#39;s actually extremely important how are you going to be able to optimize for that environment if you&amp;#39;re getting this distorted input they do that by keeping you on device on screen in app longer and they&amp;#39;re transmitting a signal through your brain I really think we&amp;#39;re setting up our children for failure that&amp;#39;s wild and no one&amp;#39;s talking about this it&amp;#39;s a tragedy what&amp;#39;s up guys welcome to this week&amp;#...

light and you can break that down into what spectrum of light it is and for me that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s probably infrared Nu UV but at a high level I would say maybe even more important that that infrared light is one of the biggest nutrient deficiencies because of our modern indoor environment and and what we did in the morning today is vitally important for many different reasons and we got out there right after we woke up the sun you know hadn&amp;#39;t even crested The Horizon so we&amp;#...

that&amp;#39;s why you don&amp;#39;t sleep as well and your circadian rhythm can get disrupted that&amp;#39;s all true but that&amp;#39;s all localized to what you said in the pineal gland but uh I don&amp;#39;t know the exact percentage but this paper which is from an Optics engineer Scott Zimmerman who is fantastic and my background is in electrical engineering and I love the kind of engineering approach to things because it&amp;#39;s more mechanistic it&amp;#39;s holistic we&amp;#39;d like to...

potent than say vitamin C or vitamin E it actually upregulates glutathione which is our other endogenously produced Master antioxidant you can say it&amp;#39;s really incredible and for me when I started going down this Rabbit Hole it really kicked off my understanding and firm Gra grasp of how vastly important circadian health is sunlight is and just light because once you learn how potent melatonin is across the board you just can&amp;#39;t unsee it I think it quite literally can quench like 8...

infrared which is way more vast it it covers a vast Spectrum it goes from like 750 nanometers to you know tens of micrometers whereas the visible range is only from 400 net to around 700 nmet it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very narrow what we can actually see visibly so it&amp;#39;s this vast spectrum of light and from a sunlight just percentage perspective people throw around numbers like 50 55% of the light is infrared this paper highlights from a photons per second perspective it&amp;#39;s on aver...

know blue light potentially causing skin cancer and things like that but it&amp;#39;s really the imbalance it&amp;#39;s really everything we&amp;#39;re mentioning here is because there&amp;#39;s an imbalance in these artificial environments because there&amp;#39;s no infrared and why is there no infrared because glass and because indoor lighting is completely omitting that and just not putting it back in and that&amp;#39;s a byproduct of this modern lighting transformation and overall just the e...

but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the issue here is that you&amp;#39;re imbalancing it and so we have a situation where a lot of people listening to this podcast might be in an office setting when I was in my residency right I&amp;#39;m in the hospital or in an office all day long 12 hours I live my residency at the University of Washington in Seattle I would get to the hospital at 6:30 5:30 in the morning the lights the sun&amp;#39;s not even up in the winter in Seattle I hav...

have a mini fire in an incandescent bulb and that&amp;#39;s why the spectrum is almost exactly the same and that&amp;#39;s great because you&amp;#39;re not getting a ton of the visible um you&amp;#39;re getting a tiny bit of blue more green more yellow more orange more red and then even more infrared and it goes far into like the mid infrared spectrum and it&amp;#39;s close it&amp;#39;s very close to sunlight in terms of the infrar red um kind of spectrum that you&amp;#39;re getting uh but I thi...

perfect example plants actually reflect green and infrared light so when we&amp;#39;re in like a really green environment we&amp;#39;re getting maybe even more of a percentage like 80 plus% of photons could be infrared light and that&amp;#39;s why we feel really good like Forest bathing obviously fresh air and ground if you&amp;#39;re doing that but it might be mostly because of infrared light so I think in the winter time when we do have you know this Seasonal effective disorder everyone does t...
